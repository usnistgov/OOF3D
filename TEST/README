This directory contains tests that ensure that OOF2 is installed and
is running correctly.  The tests in this directory only test aspects
of the program that are not related to graphical user interface.  The
GUI subdirectory contains tests for the user interface.

To run the tests, cd to this directory, and type 
    python regression.py
This will run the full suite of tests and create a lot of output.  The
tests were successful if the last output line is "OK".

It's possible to run a subset of the tests by running any of the other
.py files in the directory.

If any of the tests fail, please send a note to
oof_bugs@ctcms.nist.gov.  Include the output from the test, and let us
know the OOF2 version number, what kind of computer you're using
(including the operating system, compiler, and python version
numbers), and how you built and installed OOF2.

To run the graphical tests, cd to the GUI subdirectory and read the
README file there.
