Define a virtual material or pixelgroup called "<North>","<South>","<East>","<West>".
Also add a parameter called "<Any>".
     To define the usual 'top' boundary, one could specify an interface between
"<North>" and "<Any>", or specify an interface around "<North>".

Four of us got together in the computer/arcade room.
1. Create a mesh boundary for each interface definition.
2. 'top', 'bottom', 'left', 'right' are default interface names instead of skeleton boundaries.
   Which raises the question, how to define the 'top' boundary as an interface?
   Possibilities: (1) 'top', etc. are created automatically and are immutable/undeletable.
   (2) Create a new InterfaceDef that specifies the 'top' boundary etc. If 'top' is deleted, user
   can choose to create another one later.
3. When assigning/deleting interface materials, add a skeleton parameter. If skeleton=<all>,
   list the skeleton boundary names that are common to all the skeletons in the microstructure.
4. Undecided on a more elegent rule in specifying the interface material for an edge that belongs
   to several interfaces/boundaries.

Description of the status of interface construction in OOF2.

1. Basic effect of defining an interface or boundary:
If it is defined along interior edges of a mesh,
the mesh gets split along the interface, in the sense that any two elements that
share an edge belonging to the interface do not have nodes in common (except for the
end points of a connected piece of the interface, if the endpoint does not terminate
on the external edge of the mesh.).

*To turn this splitting effect off, open skeleton.py, jump to the femesh method,
and set split_interface to False.

Interface materials may be assigned to interfaces and skeleton boundaries.
When a mesh is created, an Edgement is created for each edge belonging to an
interface or skeleton boundary.
Each edgement stores a list of names of interfaces and skeleton boundaries.
*The last interface or skeleton boundary in the list determines the material
and orientation of the Edgement.* (This may not be an obvious choice.
If the last interface in the list does not have a material, but the others
in the list do, then the Edgement will not have a material assigned to it.
This may be undesirable.) The orientation of an Edgement refers to which
'bulk' element is on the 'left' side of the Edgement's edge.

Because there is no longer a 1-1 correspondence between skeleton nodes
and realmesh nodes, the meshindex attribute of a skeleton node has been removed.
(The meshindex carried by skeleton elements is still there of course.)

2. There is an option to create a skeleton boundary based on an interface definition.
This skeleton boundary is independent of the interface. Since the interface may
be composed of disconnected edges, the skeleton boundary in this case
(and only in this case) is allowed to be non-sequenceable.
The "Add segments" modifier is not allowed for such boundaries.
Once a boundary is tagged as not sequenceable, subsequent modifications
will not change this tag for non-sequenceability.

3. The surface tension property is equivalent to applying a Force BC
   on the end-nodes of each edge. The direction of the force is along the edge.
   This is correct for small-deformations.
   The stiffness matrix contributions are made in Property::end_element.

4. What triggers a mesh rebuild (if at least one interface is defined on the microstructure):
   (1) Interfaces get added or removed.
   (2) Bulk materials get deleted.
   (3) Bulk materials get assigned to pixels.
   (4) Pixel groups get destroyed or changed.
   Modifications to skeleton boundaries do *not* trigger a rebuild of the mesh.

5. Thread-safety may be an issue, particularly in interfaceplugin.py.

6. Continuity and JumpBC are implemented using FloatBC on pairs of 'partner' nodes
   in the Edgement. The sense or direction of the continuity constraints are
   (value on 'right' side) - (value on 'left' side) = jumpvalue.
   The hidden BCs are constructed in femesh.spy.

7. EdgementDisplay is provided for inspecting edgements. These only display
   one side (the 'left') of the interface or boundary (this can be seen when the mesh is deformed).
   Note that edgements are created automatically for normal edge boundaries
   (e.g. 'top', 'bottom', 'left', 'right').

8. It would have been easy to put buttons in the Skeleton Boundaries Page that lets one
   assign interface materials to boundaries, but I decided to let the user assign materials
   to skeleton boundaries (as well as to interfaces) via the Materials Page instead.

9. The MS plugin handling the list of interfaces and material assignments, as well as the
   registered classes that implement the interface definitions, are found in interfaceplugin.py.

10. Other important files: femesh.spy, skeleton.py,
		           interfacemenu.py, interfaceparameters.py,
			   interfacePage.py, interfacewidget.py,
			   TEST/interface_test.py ...

1. Skeleton boundaries CAN be created from Interfaces,
   even if the interface is non-sequenceable.
2. Interface names must be unique from Skeleton boundary names.
3. When specifying a field discontinuity BC, the input is a list of
   Interfaces and Edge boundaries derived from Skeleton boundaries.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
September 13, 2007

1. Skel Boundaries automatically created from interfaces
2. If such a boundary is not contiguous don't let certain types
   of boundary conditions be applied.
3. Interface materials can be applied on the interface page,
   material page, and skeleton bdy page.
4. All boundaries are split in the mesh, but implicit floating bcs
   tie nodes together by default.
5. Materials assigned to interfaces in the skeleton bdy page are *not* propagated
   to the underlying interface, because the skeleton bdy page refers to just one skeleton.
   At mesh construction time, will have to check skeleton bdy, then interface,
   when looking for interface material.
6. Cohesion, friction, surface tension are interface material properties.
6a. Discontinuities, etc are boundary conditions.
7. Discontinuities specified relative to the left (or right) side of a split node pair,
   so fixed bc can intersect with split node.

Hi Rhonald --

Here's a summary of things from our meeting today -- you said you  
wanted something in writing to remind you (or was it to have evidence  
in case we change our minds again later?)

1.  When a mesh is created, all 1D interfaces in the skeleton result  
in split nodes in the mesh.

2.  All split nodes have implicit floating boundary conditions that  
enforce field continuity across the interface.  These boundary  
conditions are hidden from the user, just like the ones that  
implement periodicity.

3.  Field discontinuities are imposed by Dirichlet, Neumann, or  
floating boundary conditions on the interface.  Explicitly imposed  
boundary conditions trump the implicit ones.

4.  Surface tension is an interface Property, not a boundary  
condition.  There will be other interface properties, eventually.

5.  We may be able to use the current user interface page layout, or  
we may want to add a new page that handles both interfacial  
properties and boundary conditions.

5a. If we're using the current page layout, when assigning an  
interfacial property or boundary condition to an interface, the  
widget for choosing the interface should have a pull-down list of  
existing named interfaces, and a button for creating a new named  
interface.  New named interfaces can be created by specifying the  
pixel groups and materials on either side, or by boolean operations  
on other groups, etc.  How can named interfaces be edited, renamed,  
or destroyed?

I remembered one more item from our discussion -- there's no need to  
automatically subdivide interfaces.  If two interfaces intersect and  
the user wants to apply different boundary conditions on either side  
of the intersection, then the user should define new skeleton  
boundaries on either side.  If the user wants to have different  
conditions on either side of a discontinuity (for example, to have  
different surface tensions on either side of a crack that is  
following a material boundary), it ought to be possible to devise an  
interfacial property that does the job.

Materials can be added to pixels in a Microstructure, as usual, or to
MaterialInterfaces.  MaterialInterfaces are specified by giving the
names of the two Materials on either side.  The interfaces are
directed by saying which Material is on the right.  (This is done with
Materials, not with pixel groups, because there's no guarantee that
Skeleton edges correspond to pixel group boundaries.)

When specifying the Materials for an interface, it's possible to use
regular expressions.  The code will be smart enough NOT to make a
interface between two identical materials.  If both Materials are
given by "*", then boundaries are created between all adjacent
elements that have different materials.

It's possible that one of the Materials is 'None', so that properties
may be assigned to the exterior borders.

If regular expressions are too complicated for the user to deal with,
we can define MaterialSets, which are constructed by boolean
operations on Materials:

   Material name [is | contains| begins with | ends with] <string>
   Material contains Property whose name [is | contains | etc] <string>

Then MaterialInterfaces can be created from two Materials *or*
MaterialSets.

InterfacialProperties can be added to any Material.  The
InterfacialProperties will only be used if the Material is explicitly
added to a MaterialInterface  in the Microstructure.  (Should it be
used for every exterior edge of the Material?)

One dimensional elements are created when a Skeleton creates a Mesh.
They live only in the Mesh, and not in the Skeleton.  If a
MaterialInterface is defined for the two Materials in the Elements on
either side of a Segment, and if a Material has been assigned to that
MaterialInterface, then that Segment is made into a one dimensional
element.

If the MaterialInterfaces in a Microstructure change, then the Mesh
will be out of date.  It should be possible to add and remove one
dimensional elements pretty easily without having to recreate the
whole mesh.  If wouldn't be that hard to recreate the mesh and copy
the fields over, though.

There also needs to be a mechanism for assigning Materials to
SkeletonBoundaries.  This will allow cracks to be introduced, for
example.

----------------

One-D Elements:

Should *always* contain split nodes, even if they're not necessary.
It will probably be easier to add constraint equations saying that the
fields are the same on both halves of a split node, rather than to
figure out when split nodes are necessary.

Because each 1D element adds nodes, it also has to add equations.
Sometimes these come from its Properties.  If the Properties don't
imply enough equations, new equations have to be created
automatically.  These should just impose field continuity.

----------------

Properties:

Do we need/want a separate class for InterfacialProperties, or do we
just add virtual functions to the existing Property class?  Do we add
an 'interfacial=1' flag to the PropertyRegistration?  I don't know.

The fluxmatrix function for InterfacialProperties will have to
somehow know the Materials of the Elements on either side.  This can
be done during the cross_reference step.

SurfaceTension:
  Adds a contribution to the stress, proportional to the 1-d strain.
  Could depend on the orientation of the Materials on either side.

(Dis)Continuity:
  Fields can have a specified jump, possibly zero.

InducedFlux:  (not the best name?)
  Flux depends on field discontinuity or value.
