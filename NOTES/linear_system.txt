Notes on low-level construction of the linear system, for up to
second-order (and extensible to more, I suppose) time-dependence.


The linear system consists, in principle, of three matrices and two
vectors.  The three matrices we have been calling M, C, and K.  They
are the contributions to the equations proportional to the second time
dervivative, first time derivative, and zeroth time derivative of the
degrees of freedom.  The two vectors are the constant part of the
equations, f, and the values of the equations, v.  The latter vector
is only required for nonlinear systems, and may not be relevant to
dynamics.

The equations we are solving, by the time we're down at this low
level, are the linearized version of the equations in the problem, and
have this general form:

          2
         d u         du
    M    ---j  + C   --j  + K  u  + f  = 0 
     ij    2      ij dt      ij j    i
         dt 


What we want is a systematic and extensible way of constructing all of
these objects.

In OOF terms, we imagine three types of equations.

Force Equations: These are "ordinary" equations, like the existing
force balance equation.  In zeroth-order in time, they are divergence
equations, and their components correspond to forces.  There is one
row of the matrices for each component of these equations at each
node.

Flux Equations: These equations have components corresponding to flux
components, and are primarily (exclusively?) used to constrain the
out-of-plane components of a flux.  Might go away in 3D, and might be
obsoleted by the next type.  There is one row of the matrices for each
component of these equations at each node.

Pointwise Constraint Equations: These equations are not integrated in
weak form, they typically apply at a particular point in space.  There
is one row of the matrices for each component of these at each point.
They come in two basic flavors, a GaussPoint version and a Node
version.  Both may be contributed to by either GaussPoint or Nodal
DOFs, but the component they constrain is either a Nodal or GaussPoint
object, they can't in general be mixed. Plasticity could be done as a
GaussPoint Constraint Equation, but in fact it will probably be done
independently of the global matrix.


Equations need to be computed if they are contributed to, and they are
contributed to if, for a given material in an element, any of the
active properties in the material contributes to this equation.
Properties are active if *all* of the dependent fields of the property
are *defined*.


This may require changes to the cross-checking, and will certainly
involve changes (but possibly rationalizations, also) to the property
API.


So the algorithm becomes:

(During the problem setup, and every time properties are added to or
removed from materials in the mesh, in a function in the mesh class:)

- Determine the integration order, and from this, the number of
gausspoints on each element.  Re-interpolate gauss-point data, if
required, to populate gausspoint DOFs, and make sure the DOF and
equation lists remain consistent.

  This involves extra storage at each element, but this will
also be true of the GaussPoint data itself, which implicitly
scales with the number of elements, even if it's not actually
stored within them.

  Materials must be able to answer per-subproblem questions about
consistency of their state -- property activation depends on 
field definition, and field definition happens in subproblem 
scope.

For the subproblem under study, begin with the subproblem's
make_linear_system routine.

- Identify all the elements of the subproblem, and all the defined and
active fields.  Determine, from the materials and properties, which
fluxes and equations we need to compute contributions for.  These
fluxes and equations are "active".  A flux is active if there is a
property which contributes to it for which all of that property's
dependent fields are defined on this subproblem.  An equation is
active if it has a contribution from an active flux, or if there is a
property which contributes directly to it for which all of that
property's dependent fields are defined on the subproblem.

- Initialize the linear system object for this time for this
subproblem with the appropriate matrix sizes, deduced from the number
of DOFs and equations.

- For each element in a subproblem: 

  (Now we are in the element's make_linear_system routine)
  Identify the material, and determine from the properties and defined
  fields which equations will have contributions, either directly,
  or indirectly through fluxes.
  

  
  For each gausspoint:
  
    (Now we are in the Material's make_linear_system)

    Construct a flux matrix for each active flux for each time-order,
      and a vector for the offset (all stored in a SmallSystem
      object).

    Evaluate these flux matrices by calling all the contributing
      properties, looping over the "nu" nodes.  The nu-nodal loop is
      outside of the properties, so props need to know the absolute
      minimum about the elements.

      
    For each node:

      (Inside the equations?  Fluxes?  Still in the Material?)
      For each force equation:
   
        For each time-order:

          Identify the properties which contribute directly at this 
            time-order, and have them compute their force-matrix.
          Distribute this force-matrix into the appropriate global 
            matrix, M, C, or K, depending on the time-order, and 
            multiply by the jacobian and the gaussian weight.
          For the same properties, compute their contribution to 
            the constant part of the linear system, f.
	  
          Identify the fluxes which contribute to this equation

          For each flux:
            Distribute the flux matrix into the global matrix, M, C, or K,
              multiplying by the shape function derviative (for the 
              divergence), the jacobian, and the gaussian weight.         
	    Compute the properties' contributions to f.       

      For each flux equation:

        For each time-order:

          For the flux:

            Distribute the flux matrix values and accumulate the
               global matrix M, C, or K, multiplying by the jacobian,
               and the gaussian weight.
            Compute the properties' contributions to f.

    For each constraint equation: (outside node loop here, inside gpt loop)

       For each time-order:

         Identify contributing properties, and make the entries 
            directly into the global matrix M, C, or K, and f.  No
            integration, so no jacobians or gaussian weights.

  The change from the current system begins after the material's
make_linear_system has been called.  In the old version, the
Material::make_linear_system looped over fluxes, and the fluxes called
the equations to make their contributions.  In the new version,
Material::make_linear_system will first see which equations are
required, and call their make_linear_system routine, and the equations
will do the flux computations.

There is no danger of inefficiency due to recomputation of redundant
data, because flux contribution data is precomputed.


  For nonlinear static problems for which we want to use an NR-type
algorithm, equations must also be able to evaluate themselves.  For
linear constitutive contributions, the value of the equation is just
the contraction of the matrix with the DOFs, so no new API components
are required.  For nonlinear constitutive contributions, the
properties must be able to make their contribution to the value of the
equation or flux, for a given set of values for the dependent DOFs.

  In the time-dependent case, this evaluation is not necessary, because
the linear system you end up solving does not contain the direct
values of the equations as important quantitites.


  The Property API will have to include the capability to make all of
these contributions.  At least two functions are required, one that's
called for each node, and another that's only called once per element.
Properties will be responsible for making the appropriate
time-derivative contributions in each function, which shouldn't be too
complicated, as individual properties probably won't actually make
more than one contribution.


  For equation evaluation (required for nonlinear properties):
    
    evaluate_force(..)
    evaluate_flux(..)    

  For flux contributions, the two required routines strongly resemble
the previous scheme.  The iterated routine called for each node is the
"flux_matrix" routine, which will pass in the flux matrix object
containing all the time derviative contirbutions.  It will be the
responsibility of this routine to make contributions to the
appropriate submatrix.  The flux matrix object should provide
access functions that make this straightforward.

    flux_matrix
    flux_offset

  For force contributions:

    force_matrix
    force_offset

  Same basic idea -- properties will make the appropriate 
contributions to the internal subobjects of the equation matrix,
and the equations themselves will then move this data to the
appropriate part of the subproblem-scope linear_system object.


  These functions will be called within the element/gausspoint loop, and
will provide the contributed-to flux or force as an argument.  The
"force" argument might just be the equation itself.

  For now, we assume that flux contributions will depend on nodal
degrees of freedom, and that force contributions will depend on
gausspoint degrees of freedom.  The contrary scheme is a logical
possibility, and might be added later.

  Regular book-keeping functions will mostly be the same, with possibly
a few additions for "Force" contribution management.  Properties may
require additional registration entries, e.g. saying what time-orders
they contribute to, and which forces or equations, if required, in
addition to fluxes.


Property, Equation, and Problem bookkeeping:


  Properties must tell the system:
  - Their name
  - Their type ("Elasticity", etc.)
  - What other properties they need access to ("Orientation", "Elasticity"...)
  - What fields need to be defined for them to operate.
  - What fluxes they contribute to (and for what time derivatives?)
  - What equations they contribute to (and for what time derivatives?)
  - Whether they are nonlinear.

  Nonlinear properties in static problems will be asked to evaluate
their flux or force contributions directly.  Linear properties in
static problems can have their contributions deduced by the caller, by
contracting their matrix contribution with the actual DOFs.


  Force Equations should have names, and know which flux divergences
contribute to them.  The names properties use for force contributions
should be the same as the corresponding Force Equation name.  Forces
do not need to be separate objects, because a Force Equation *is* a
Force.

  
  Flux equations won't change -- they need to know the flux they
constrain, of course.

  Pointwise Constraint Equations will be similar to Force equations,
they'll have names, and can identify contributing properties from
their declared Pointwise Constraint contributions. These equation
objects will be specified by users, but unlike the other forms, may be
automatically added to the mesh during the solution step in response
to violations of the constraint.

  Pointwise Constraint Equations are going to be fairly closely related
to their contributing properties, which may pose architectural
challenges.

  As before, Materials will be restricted to one property of each
type.


How to Proceed:
---------------

  Start with the current divergence equation, and rewrite it to use the
new scheme, making appropriate calls to the properties to build all of
the matrices.  Remove the specialized time-dependent term from the
initializer.
 

  Equation classes/attributes:

  Equation
    int components;
    std::string name;
    (pythonexportable/identifiedobject stuff)
    const unsigned int index_;
  Functions for iterating over components, and so forth.


The gauss point issue
---------------------

  Storage:

  We don't want to add gausspoints to elements, that's wasteful.  Since
gausspoints live in master space anyways, all we really need to know
is the order of integration, and the mesh can know that.  As long as
elemental gausspoints for a given order of integration always occur in
the same order, we can just use an integer index as a proxy for the
GaussPoint object, and not have to store anything.

  Change-over:
  
  The current time-dependent scheme provides for a "mesh state" which
has both time and DOF variables, but doesn't couple them, except when
the mesh is evolving.  During evolution, the number of gausspoints
can't change.  At other times (adding/removing properties, manually
changing the integration order), gausspoint DOFs can be interpolated
on elements, either on the fly, or prior to the solution.  If
multistep methods require intermediate data, this data can also be
generated by interpolation.
