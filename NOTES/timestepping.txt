# ---------------------------------- #

# Subproblems: Solve all subproblems together, with same dt, but use
# different methods for each, if requested.

# For each time step:

# A. Take a QC step for each subproblem, using extrapolated or
#    interpolated data from other subproblems, if necessary.
#    (Subproblems using the same solver that really really want to be
#    solved together should be combined into a single
#    UnionSubproblem.)

# B. Repeat all subproblems until answers are consistent, since the
#    extrapolated data might not have been good enough.  This step can
#    be optional, under user control.  Be sure to test for the trivial
#    case, and don't iterate if there's only one subproblem.

# C. Check error for all subproblems, and either reduce time step and
#    repeat the step, or increase it and go on.  Use the most
#    restrictive subproblem.

# Should B and C be reversed?  Reduce the step size for each
# subproblem before going on to the next?  Then only require
# consistency at the shortest time?

# ----------------------------- #

# Issues:

# Need a way of turning internal bcs on and off so that one subproblem
# can provide a bc for another.  When assigning bcs, assign them to a
# specific subproblem, or to all subproblems?

# Subproblems need to be able to provide interpolated/extrapolated
# data.  (Need to know their TimeSteppers, which know how to do the
# interpolation to the correct order?)  Need equivalents for
# Element::outputField() (& variations), Field::value() and
# Field::output().

## No. ODEDriver should know t_{n+1} data for those dofs that have
## computed it.  Just use linear interpolation/extrapolation if
## t_{n+1} data is known, and previous value (at t_n) otherwise.
## ODEDriver can be asked for value of dof at any time (but will be
## more accurate if time is within the current step).  If a Mesh can
## only have one ODEDriver at a time, then the data can be stored in
## the driver and accessible from the Nodes.


# TimeSteppers (QCTimeSteppers?) should cache computations that only
# use data from the beginning of a step, so that it can be reused if
# the step is repeated.

# For dynamics, need to store dField/dt as an additional Field at each
# Node.  Will need to be initialized.  It should be created when its
# "dynamic" flag is turned on in the *Fields* GUI page.

# Nodes currently only store info at current time...  Mesh
# (ODEDriver?) can store previous/next time step data and use dofindex
# to access it.

#--------------

# SubProblem matrix computation:
# *  Subproblems keep previous matrices in a cache.
# * Are told when Fields have changed, so non-linear subproblems know
#   when matrices have to be regenerated:
#     SubProblem.fieldChanged(field, time)
# * SubProblem.discard_matrices_predating(time) cleans the matrix cache.
# * Matrices retrieved by SubProblem.getM(dofs, time), etc.  Allows for lazy
#   computation and trade-off between speed & memory (by not using
#   cache).

# --------------

# Evaluation of DoFs at different times at Nodes (and GaussPoints?)

# 1. Before starting timestepping, subproblems make their own copies
# of their *active* Fields DoFs.

# 2. The Mesh knows in which subproblems each Field is active.  It's
# an error for a Field to be active in more than one subproblem at any
# given Node, but this might be hard or impractical to check for.

# 3. While timestepping, subproblems keep copies of the DoF value
# vectors at various times.  The times may differ from subproblem to
# subproblem.

# 4. Before evaluating matrices at a given time, a subproblem
# announces its intentions to the mesh.  The mesh asks the *other*
# subproblems to interpolate their active field values to the given
# time, and to copy them back into the DoFs themselves (or the mesh's
# vector of DoF values). The subproblem being solved will have to copy
# its DoF values to the DoFs too, but the time will be determined by
# the solver (ie, don't interpolate!).  Fields that aren't active but
# which have time-dependent initializers have to be reinitialized.
# Optimization: do this only for fields which are used by the current
# subproblem's properties.  Unused fields can be safely out-of-date.

# 5. After all subproblems have converged on a solution and the target
# time is reached, all values of active fields are copied back from
# the subproblems into the DoFs.  At this point the mesh is again
# self-consistent at the new time, and outputs can be computed.

# Optimization: store DoF values in a vector in the Mesh, and arrange
# for each subproblem to have its Field values stored contiguously in
# the vector.  Then copying will be faster.  It may be worthwhile to
# rearrange the DoF indexing before solving, once it's known which
# Fields are active in which subproblems.


# Each subproblem keeps two lists of DoF values, one for the start and
# one for the end of the current timestep.  It also knows the times of
# the start and end, so that it can compute interpolated values, if
# necessary.  If the end hasn't been computed yet, it just uses the
# starting values.  DoF values are stored in a DOFLIST object, which
# is swigged.  Python never explicitly loops over the components of a
# DOFLIST.  All operations on it should be done with memcpy or blas.
