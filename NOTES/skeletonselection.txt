Overview:

The SkeletonContext is a WhoDoUndo object and contains an undo buffer,
a RingBuffer instance called "undobuffer", which contains CSkeleton
and CDeputySkeleton objects.

For each type of selectable Skeleton component (elements, faces,
segments, and nodes) the SkeletonContext contains an instance of a
skeletonselectable.Selection subclass (ElementSelection,
NodeSelection, etc).  The Selection contains a stack (implemented as a
RingBuffer) which contains SelectionSet instances.  This stack is the
undo buffer for selection operations.  Each SelectionSet represents
the selection state for every Skeleton in the SkeletonContext's undo
buffer.

A SelectionSet contains a WeakKeyDictionary, keyed by CSkeletons and
CDeputySkeletons, of CSelectionTrackers and CDeputySelectionTrackers.
The CSelectionTrackers are the things that actually know what objects are
selected, storing that information in a CSkeletonSelectableSet called
"data".  CDeputySelectionTrackers don't store any selection data,
because deputy skeletons contain the same CSkeletonSelectables as the
"sheriff" skeletons that they're the deputies for.  The deputy
trackers just relay all requests to their sheriffs.

Thus there is a 2 dimensional (skeleton state X selection state) space
occupied by Trackers.  One dimension is the skeleton modification
undo/redo axis, represented by the SelectionSet, and the other is the
selection undo/redo axis, represented by the Selection's stack, which
contains the SelectionSets.


Adding a new Skeleton:

When a new CSkeleton or CDeputySkeleton is pushed onto the
SkeletonContext's undobuffer, the "whodoundo push" signal is emitted
and is caught by SelectionBase.whoChanged0.  (There's a TODO about
just calling whoChanged0 or the equivalent directly.)  whoChanged0
calls SelectionSet.implied_select for each SelectionSet in the
Selection's stack.  implied_select creates a new Tracker for each
selection state and the new skeleton.

SelectionBase.whoChanged0()
  for each SelectionSet:
     SelectionSet.implied_select()
       make new CSelectionTracker or CDeputySelectionTracker
       newtracker.implied_select(oldtracker)
          for CDeputySelectionTrackers this is a no-op
          for CSelectionTrackers:
              for each object in the old trackers data
                 CSkeletonSelectable::implied_select(oldtracker, newtracker)
		    add the object to the new tracker's data if any of
		    the objects parents in the old skeleton are in the
		    old tracker's data.


Modifying a Selection:

The menus (OOF.NodeSelection et al) are built from the
SkeletonModifier Registrations by skeletonselectmenu.makeMenu.  The
different types of modifier (NodeSelectionModifier,
FaceSelectionModifier, etal) each have their own RegisteredClass.  The
menu item callback is skeletonselectionmod.modify().  It creates an
instance of the RegisteredClass and calls its __call__() method.
After SelectionModifer.__call__() returns, modify() issues switchboard
signals that tell the graphics windows and gui to update themselves.

The __call__() method for each SelectionModifier first calls
Selection.start(), which pushes a clone() of the current SelectionSet
onto the Selection's stack.  It then should call some combination of
the Selection methods clear(), select(), deselect(), toggle(),
invert(), and selectSelected(), passing a list CSkeletonSelectable
objects as the argument.

These Selection methods all first get two lists of CSelectionTrackers,
clist and plist, by calling Selection.trackerlist().  clist contains
all of the trackers corresponding to the children of the sheriff of
the current CSkeleton (ie, Skeletons that are modifications of the
current sheriff, more recent in the WhoDoUndo undo buffer).  plist
contains the trackers for the parent CSkeletons.  The Selection method
loops over the CSkeletonSelectable objects in the current CSkeleton
whose selection state is being modified, and calls their select() or
deselect() method as appropriate, passing clist and plist as
arguments.

CSkeletonSelectable::select() and deselect() use selecthelper() (a
static function) and various virtual functions to move along the lists
of trackers and change the selection.  selecthelper is given one of
the tracker lists (either clist or plist), a list of the
CSkeletonSelectable's relatives (children or parents) and a virtual
CSelectionTracker method (either selectDown (for children) or selectUp
(for parents).  It moves to the next item in the tracker list and
calls the given method for each of the relatives.  The method is
virtual: for non-deputy Trackers it calls the corresponding
CSkeletonSelectable method (selectUp(), selectDown(), deselectUp(),
etc); for deputy trackers, it calls the same method for the next
tracker in the list, because deputy trackers don't store any
information about the selection state, all of which is stored in the
sheriff.

CSkeletonSelectable::selectUp(), deselectDown(), etc, select or
deselect the object (by setting the "select" flag and adding or
removing from the tracker) after checking the selection state of the
object's parents and children.  This is the point at which the rules
about how selections are propagated to and from multiple parents and
children are applied. (For example, a child is deselected only if none
of its parents are selected.)  selecthelper() is then called to
continue the process on the next CSkeleton.


Making a Selection with the Mouse:

SkeletonSelectionMode (in skeletonselmodebase.py) and its subclasses
(NodeSelectionMode, etc, in skeletonselectionmodes.py) contain
information that tells the generic selection code where to find menus,
retrieve selected objects, etc.

SkeletonSelectionToolbox is a subclass of GenericSelectionToolbox (in
common/IO/genericselecttoolbox.py).  The toolbox's menu items are
automatically generated from the registries of the SelectMethod
registered classes defined in skeletonselectionmethod.py
(NodeSelectMethod, et al).  Each menu command knows which Registration
it was created from.  The callback for the menu items is
GenericSelectionToolbox.selectCB().  This callback first uses the
Registration to create an instance of its SelectionMethod.  It then
calls Selection.start() and the SelectionMethod's select() method,
passing along a "selector", which is a Selection function
(Select.select(), Select.toggle(), etc from skeletonselectable.py).
The choice of selector is determined by whether the shift and control
keys were pressed when the mouse button was released.

The select() method of the SelectMethod subclass must create a list of
CSkeletonSelectable objects and pass them to the given selector
function.  From this point the process is the same as it is for
selection modification.
