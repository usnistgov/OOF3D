  July 2020:  This is intended to be an update and revision
to the "timestepping.txt" file in this directory.  It's both 
about how time-steppers work, and how they relate to the 
evolution process, as well the operational model they use
for subproblems, solvers, and the linearized system.

  This is motivated by the implementation of the crystal plasticity,
which might break some of these assumptions, and/or leverage 
them.
