Things that have to be done during or before equilibration:

* Read input file with material and property definitions (Python)

* Construct materials and properties. (Python driven C++)  After
  adding all properties to a material, properties use the material's
  property registry to cross reference each other. (C++)

* Read node positions and elements (Python).  Construct nodes and
  elements (C++).

* Find out what Fields are in use, by asking each Material. (Python?)
  No -- user determines what Fields are in use.

* Initialize fields (C++?)

* Initialize Fluxes and Equations.  Equations tell the Fluxes that
  they're interested in them.

* Reset equation numbers in all the nodes.

* Set boundary condition flags in all the nodes -- ie, apply FieldBC's. (C++)

* Assign global indices to degrees of freedom.  (C++)
  "Interior" degrees of freedom come first, followed by "boundary", so
  that global stiffness matrix partitions properly.
    interior == field is active and dof isn't fixed (contributes to matrix)
    boundary == field is active and dof is fixed (contributes to rhs)
    unused == field is inactive

* Have each Material ask its Properties to precompute things that can
  be precomputed by calling Property::precompute(). (C++)

* Have each Element add its contribution to the stiffness matrices &
  rhs.  It does that by asking its Material to ask its Properties to
  make their contributions.  Each Property knows what fields it
  affects.  During this process, equation numbers are assigned at
  nodes, so that data goes into the correct columns of K. (C++)
  (See below for more up-to-date details.)

* Solve for active fields. (C++)

Mesh Iterators:

for(NodeIterator i(mesh); !i.end(); i++)
  Node *node = mesh[i];

for(ElementIterator i(mesh); !i.end(); i++)
  Element *element = mesh[i];

Different kinds of ElementIterators: ElementIterator(mesh, EI_SELECTED)

--

Don't need interiorE and boundaryE in Mesh. Only need one list of elements.

---

Two classes of Master Elements: TriangularMaster and QuadrilateralMaster.
   Each keeps tables of Gauss Points.
Different kinds of MasterElements with different numbers of nodes are
   derived from them.
Shapefunctions are precomputed at ALL gauss points, for all orders of
   integration.

---

Each element type may have TWO sets of shapefunctions, one used to
compute mapping and one used for function interpolation. Map shape
functions are only used internally (in the
Element/MasterElement/ShapeFunction classes) but the interpolation
functions are used externally in the Property classes.

ShapeFunctionCache should be associated with ShapeFunction, not with
Element. It can be static in each derived ShapeFunction class, so it
won't ever have to be reallocated.  So the ShapeFunction will contain
*two* distinct lookup tables -- ShapeFunctionCache for quantities that
depend on the Element, and ShapeFunctionTable for quantities that
don't. 

How to refer to shapefunctions? Can't simply use NodeIndex, because a
set of shape functions may not have a function for each node in the
element. Perhaps MasterElement needs
  virtual ShapeFunctionIndex shapefunction(NodeIndex) const = 0;  No.....

* Property has to loop over nodes, use shapefunction appropriate for a
  node.

* jacobian, Jdmasterdx have to loop over map shapefunctions, use node
  appropriate for a shapefunction.  Or loop over map nodes, use
  appropriate map shapefunctions.

ElementNodeIterator can return a NodeIndex used to get a node,
and a ShapeFunctionIndex used to get a shapefunction.  Each derived
element class has its own type of ElementNodeIterator, and therefore
its own relationship between nodes and shapefunctions.

Element::shapefun can take a ElementNodeIterator instead of a
NodeIndex arg.

det_jacobian, etc should be computed and cached in the ShapeFunction base
class. 

*** The connection between Nodes and their corresponding shape
    functions is made by the ElementNodeIterator class: 
      Node *ElementNodeIterator::node()
      ShapeFunctionIndex ElementNodeIterator::sf_index()
    This connection is used, for example, in Element::Jdmasterdx().

---

To make contributions to Kij and rhs from boundaries, need to be able
to loop over element edges that are on boundaries.

What kinds of boundary conditions can be specified?
* Fixed positions of nodes
* Fixed positions of edges (effectively the same as fixed nodes)
* Flux through edges

Generally, when fields aren't specified on the bdy, the fluxes must
be. The flux is of the form $\sigma=K\cdot\grad u$, where u is the
field. This quantity may be a vector (eg heat current) or a tensor (eg
elastic stress).  Only the normal component is actually used -- the
contribution to the rhs is $\oint dl \phi_j \hat n\cdot\sigma$.

Should Property be a templated class, derived from a common base?  NO
The template arguments are the types of the field and the flux:
Property<double, Vector<double> > : temperature
Property<Vector<double>, StrainStress> : elasticity
Then what about couplings?

It's better to leave the Property class alone, but have a
BoundaryCondition object which can be passed to
Property::boundary_flux, and which can be queried for the flux of a
given Field at an edge.

---

FLUX

There should be a Flux class, somewhat analogous to the Field class.

Field values are stored in Nodes, as lists of DoF's.
Where are flux values stored?
They're not; they're just computed as needed.  Maybe they're stored
in an output object of some sort.

How does Property::integrate_flux know which flux to integrate?
How does Property::find_flux know which flux to find?  What does it do
with the result?  (Couplings can contribute to more than one Flux.)
(See below.)

Will need operator==(const Flux&, const Flux&).  find_flux will check
its Flux* argument to see which flux it should compute, do a
dynamic_cast to the appropriate derived Flux class, and call the
non-virtual DerivedFlux::add_flux(FluxType&).
(No. See below.)

---

Have to convert from vector<> to TNT::Vector<>, but only for linear
algebra vectors.  Use std::vector<> for lists, etc.
Use TNT::Matrix<> too.

Rewrite TNT operator+, etc to use BLAS!

--- 

Have to do integrals with only ONE shape function -- so scheme for
choosing Gaussian order needs to be modified!  Such integrals appear
when integrating body forces on rhs.  DONE

---

What about mutable properties?  Information will have to be stored
element by element.
  Material can keep a list of mutable properties.
  Mutable Properties are all derived from MutableProperty, which gives
      each mutable property a mutableindex, by registering itself with
      the material.
  Each Element has a list of Mutations --
      element.mutation[mutableindex] is a pointer to a Mutation
      corresponding to the appropriate MutableProperty.
  MutableProperty can have a function
      Mutation *MutableProperty::mutation() const
  that returns the Mutation corresponding to the Property. This
  Mutation can be cast to a derived type specific to the Property and
  used to store element specific data.

---

Null virtual functions in Properties

Most properties will not define all of the virtual functions in the
Property base class, so these functions are defined as {} in the base
class.  The corresponding Material functions loop over all of the
Properties, calling the virtual functions.  It may be time consuming
to call all of the null functions.  But if the base class function
throws an exception, then the Material can catch it, and keep a list
of the Properties which don't have their own implementations of a
virtual function, and avoid calling them in the future.

---

Should ElementNodeIterator have an operator()(Field) so that it acts
like a Node?
  ElementNodeIterator node;
  node(temperature) gives value
  node(temperature).index() gives dof index
  node(displacement)[i] value of component
and similarly:
  node(heateqn).index()  index into global matrix

THIS IS OBSOLETE--- use field(node) or field(elementnodeiterator)
instead of node(field).
***Should treat Equations the same way as Fields.***

---

Since indexing into rows of K is done by DoF indices, and indexing
into columns is done by Node::eqno(), how is the symmetry of K
preserved?  If a property produces a symmetric K, the symmetry can be
used to solve the matrix equation faster, so Node::eqno somehow has to
know about DegreeOfFreedom::dofindex().  Maybe equation numbers and
dof indices can be assigned together in some precompute stage.  This
would fit into the existing framework.

---

Each Flux should have a bool inplane.  Each Field should have
a bool inplane, inplanegradient.  NO. See below.

---

CONSTRAINTS

The constraints that reduce the problem to 2D are all linear relations
on the out-of-plane derivatives and the degrees of freedom.  For example,
   strain_{iz} = 0  (plane strain)
   stress_{iz} = 0 = C_{izkl}*strain_{kl} + ...  (plane stress)
So the out-of-plane derivatives of a field are either set to zero (or
another constant?) in plane strain, or treated as degrees of freedom
and solved for in plane stress.

This also works for thermal expansion in plane stress:
 stress_{iz} = 0 = C_{izkl}*(strain_{kl} - alpha_{kl}*deltaT)
is a linear relation among strain_{iz} and the in-plane
derivatives AND a field, deltaT.


The classes now look like this:

class Field: Used to retrieve value of a DegreeOfFreedom at a Node.
Can have one of three states: undefined, defined, active.  Active
Fields are being solved for; defined Fields have values, but aren't
being solved for.  Fields have dimensions, which include the
out-of-plane components and derivatives needed to satisfy the
constraints. For example, Displacement has 5 dimensions: u_x, u_y, and
the three out-of-plane strains.  Fields also have a list of Outputs,
for example: dx, dy, and all 6 components of strain.

Actually, the out-of-plane parts are stored in their own separate
fields.  The CompoundField class associates a Field with its
out-of-plane parts.  So Displacement is a TwoVectorField (dx, dy)
associated with a VectorField (eps_xz, eps_yz, eps_zz).

class Equation: div(flux)=force, or flux=value.  Has a dimension and a
name, and nodes can use it to find a row index into the global
stiffness matrix and rhs.  In principle, an equation may involve more
than one flux.  Equations know which fluxes they involve.  An Equation
and a Node together determine a row index in the stiffness matrix.

class Constraint: Constraints are either statements that an
out-of-plane component of the flux is zero, or that out-of-plane
derivatives are zero. Applying a Constraint either activates the
Equation flux=0, or marks a field as fixed and zero.

class BoundaryCondition: Similar to a Constraint, but acts only on
DegreesOfFreedom associated with a Field at a NodeGroup, not at all
Nodes.

class Flux: Fluxes are linear combinations of fields, in-plane field
derivatives, and out-of-plane field derivatives.  Fluxes know which
Equations they contribute to. (Do they really need to know that?)

class Property: Properties know which Fluxes they contribute to, and
which Fields they require.  Has to be able to make its contribution to
the matrix for the Flux.

class StiffnessMatrix: Stores the FE stiffness matrix for both active
and inactive degrees of freedom.

The Procedure is now:

1. User specifies which Equations are active globally, eg: Heat, ForceBalance.

2. User specifies which Constraints are active.  Activating some
   Constraints implies activating more Equations.  Eg, activating
   plane-flux constraints activates the sigma_z=0 equation.

3. Ditto for BoundaryConditions.

4. Active Equations determine the active Fluxes.  Fluxes are defined
   globally (not Node-specific, like equations)(?)

5. User specifies which Fields are defined.  The Fields corresponding
   to the out-of-plane derivatives are defined implicitly for each
   defined Field.  Fields are defined globally like Fluxes.

6. Properties are active if they contribute to an active Flux, and if
   all of the Fields they require are defined.  Properties don't need
   to store whether they're active or not, it's sufficient for them to
   compute it when asked to contribute to the stiffness matrix.  When
   they are constructed, Properties will have to tell someone (who?)
   which Fluxes and Fields they use.

7. Active properties make their contributions to the stiffness matrix
   and rhs. They don't have to know whether a DegreeOfFreedom is
   active or not, just that it belongs to a defined Field. Uses
   StiffnessMatrix(Equation, DegreeOfFreedom).

7a. No. Equation and constraint do the integration over an
   Element. They ask the Flux for the fluxmatrix -- the matrix that
   multiplies the dofs to give the flux.  Then the Equation multiplies
   the fluxmatrix by the appropriate derivative matrix, does the
   integral over the area of the Element, and makes the contribution
   to the matrix.

7b. Not quite. See below.

(Un)resolved Questions:

Q: How does the Equation numbering deal with Constraints/BC's that are
   applied at some nodes but not others? Does there have to be an
   Equation object for each row of the matrix? Ie, does an Equation
   represent the concept div sigma=f for all nodes, or does it
   represent div.sigma=f at a particular node?

A: Each node keeps a list of Equations.  The list of Equations is
   updated each time a new equation is used at a Node, by
   Node::eqno(Equation, component).  This function returns the
   equation number at the node.

[ OLD
 The list is created
   by Node::add_eqn(const Equation&) and Node::add_field(const
   Field&).  The list in the node can be an STL::map, associating
   Fields with column numbers and Equations with row numbers.  The
   column and row numbers are obtained by asking the Mesh.  Thus the
   Equation class represents the *concept*, and is not specific to a
   Node.
]

Q: Actually, equations and constraints are applied to Elements and
   Boundaries, not to Nodes. How does that affect the equation/dof
   counting?  Fields are fixed/active at Nodes, and not on Elements...

A: No, that's not quite right. The force balance takes place at Nodes,
   so it's proper to think of equations being applied at Nodes, not
   Elements. Integrating over an element makes contributions to the
   Equations at Nodes.

Q: How do Properties know how to make their contributions to the
   matrix and rhs?  One property can contribute to more than one
   Equation. For instance, Elasticity contributes to Equation
   ForceBalance and to Constraint OutOfPlaneStress.

A: Fluxes make contributions to the matrix and rhs, Properties make
   contributions to the fluxes.  Ie:

OLD
   Loop over Elements
      Material initializes all active Fluxes
      Material loops over Properties
         Property makes contributions to all active Fluxes at all GaussPts
      Material loops over active Fluxes
        Equation/Flux makes contributions to matrix and rhs

NEW
   Grid determines what Fluxes are active
   Grid determines what Properties contribute to each active Flux
   Grid loops over Elements {
      Element->Material loops over active Fluxes {
	 Loop over GaussPts {
            Initialize fluxmatrix
	    Loop over Properties contributing to flux {
	      Property::flux(Flux, Element, GaussPt, &fluxmatrix)
	    }
	    Loop over Equations that use flux {
	      Convert fluxmatrix to equationmatrix
	    }
	    multiply equationmatrix by gauss point weight
	    add equation matrix to global stiffness matrix
	 }
      } 
   }

Q: How do in-plane Fluxes activate the out-of-plane components and
   derivatives of the Fields?

A: They don't.  Whether or not a field is in-plane is independent of
   whether or not a flux is in-plane.

Q: If the Equation loads the stiffness matrix into the global one, how
   does it relate the localindex (column number) to the global index?

A: It loops over the Element's DoF's in the same way that the
   Properties do.  It can then use the Flux's indexing (which can be
   made to work for Equation) to extract a value from the local
   stiffness matrix.

Out-of-plane components of Fields

Displacement is a two-vector (u_x, u_y), and in plane strain that's
sufficient.  In plane stress, we need to also solve for three
out-of-plane components (du_x/dz, du_y/dz, du_z/dz).  How should these
extra degrees of freedom be stored and referred to?

*** Use Fields and CompoundFields...

Will Node::operator()(const ScalarField&) etc work when passed
a reference to a Field, as in node(temperature.out_of_plane()) ???
NO.
It's simpler anyway to just use functions defined in the derived Field
classes, and access dof's with field(node) or field(node, component).
These functions don't have to be defined in the Field base class,
since we'll always be referring to a concrete instance of a Field.

---

SYMMETRY:

If the problem is symmetric, there is a relationship between an
Equation number and a DegreeOfFreedom number.

---

A Flux can appear in more than one equation.  We don't want the
fluxmatrix to be computed more than once for each Property and
Element. So when computing the stiffness matrix and rhs, we have to
loop over Fluxes primarily.  After finding the fluxmatrix, the Flux
has to loop over all Equations that it appears in.

Q: How do we know which Fluxes have to be computed for an Element?
   Loop over the Material's Properties, and see which ones they
   contribute to.  But do Properties know their Fluxes, or do Fluxes
   know their Properties, or what?

A: Properties know their Fluxes. We want to be able to add a new
   Property without Property without modifying the Flux class in any
   way. But when the Property registers itself with its Material, it
   can tell the Material which Flux(es) it contributes to.


---

Elasticity:

flux
\sigma_{ij} =  C_{ijkl} \nabla_k u_l
            = (C_{ijkl} \nabla_k N_\mu) u_{\mu l}

u_{\mu l} = displacement component l and node \mu

fluxmatrix
 M_{(ij) (\mu l)} = (C_{ijkl} \nabla_k N_\mu)

f_i = \nabla_j \sigma_{ij}
    = \nabla_j M_{(ij)(\mu l)} u_{(\mu l)}

N_\nu f_i = N_\nu \nabla_j \sigma_{ij}   (integrated over the element)
          = (bdy term) - (\nabla_j N_\nu) M_{(ij)(\mu l)} u_{(\mu l)} u_{\mu l}
          = (bdy term) - D_{\nu j} M_{(ij)(\mu l)} u_{(\mu l)} u_{\mu l}

divergence operator:
D_{\nu j} = \nabla_j N_\nu     space index j contracted w/ M ==> stiffness
Multiplication D*M should be done by Flux, since it knows which index
of M to contract with D. ?


Thermal Conductivity:

flux
J_i =  \kappa_{ij} \nabla_j T
    = (\kappa_{ij} \nabla_j N_\mu) T_\mu

fluxmatrix
M_{i\mu} = (\kappa_{ij} \nabla_j N_\mu)

qdot = -\nabla_i J_i
     = -\nabla_i M_{i\mu} T_\mu

N_\nu qdot = -N_\nu \nabla_i M_{i\mu} T_\mu   (integrated over the element)
           = (bdy term) + (\nabla_i N_\nu) M_{i\mu} T_\mu

 (actually, \mu should be (\mu l), since T may be a compound field
 with out-of-plane components)

divergence operator:
D_{\nu i} = \nabla_i N_\nu   as before!

Although the Flux is the thing that knows how to multiply the
fluxmatrix by D_{\nu j}, and it would be easy for the Flux to do the
multiplication and then add the result to the global stiffness matrix,
the Flux should NOT do this.  That's because it's conceivable that the
actual Equation might be more complicated:  div(flux) might be
multiplied by a matrix, for example.

Can the FieldIndex (or a relative) be used somehow so that the
Equation can tell the Flux what multiplication to do?

OR

If the Flux does the multiplication, but returns a matrix instead of
adding to the global stiffness matrix, then how does it index the rows
of the matrix?  The rows are indexed by a component of the divergence
and a node: (\nu i) for stress, (\nu) for thermal conductivity.  Use a
generalization of ElementNodeIterator::localindex() ?

OR

The Equation constructs the matrix that the fluxmatrix is multiplied
by, and asks the Flux to do the multiplication.  The flux doesn't have
to know how the rows of the matrix are indexed.  The resulting product
will have columns indexed by Field component and node number, and rows
indexed by whatever's appropriate for that Equation (probably Equation
component and node number).
The function doing the multiplying *doesn't* have to be a virtual
function in the Flux class, since the Equation will know the derived
type of the Flux.

---

Generalized tensor index classes...

Iterator i, j, k;  // one dimensional iterators
TensorIterator a(i, j, k);  // a three dimensional iterator
TensorIterator b(i, k);     // a two dimensional iterator
ThreeTensor A;    // can be indexed by a
TwoTensor B;      // can be indexed by b

Loop over j
Loop over i and k
  C(j) += A(a)*B(b);    ???????????????

Hard to do, and probably would be too much overhead.

---

Flux matrices, etc are evaluated at Positions, not at GaussPoints, so
that the same code can be used at GaussPoints and at general Coords
(which are also derived from Position).  The trouble is that the
shapefunctions now have to be evaluated at Positions, and have to be
able to use the cached values at GaussPoints.  So a virtual function
in the Position class has to be used to distinguish between the two...

DONE, partly by adding the aforementioned virtual function, and partly
by evaluating shapefunctions only via ElementNodeIterators.

--

Cross-referencing of Properties in a Material shouldn't bail out when
one Property fails-- it should try all the Properties so that it can
return a list of all the failures.

Materials can be created with missing Properties.  They should have a
"consistent" flag that is only set when the cross referencing
succeeds, though.  Should equilibration be able to proceed
if there are inconsistent materials assigned to the mesh?  Those
properties may not be used...

Materials can't be created with redundant properties, though, so it's
ok to throw an exception in Material::addProperty()

The interface calls the Material constructor only when it has all of
the properties in hand.  There's no need to be able to remove
Properties from a Material.  To remove Properties, the GUI will read
the Properties out of a Material, delete Properties from the list, and
create a *new* Material with the remaining Properties.

---

Thoughts on the separation of the front and back ends

Front and back ends should communicate with shared memory when it's
available, and with sockets otherwise.  It would be nice not to have
to write two completely different versions of everything.

Shared memory is most easily and efficiently implemented with threads.
(Is this true?)  Python threads work on any system implementing
pthreads, as well as Windows, so using them shouldn't affect
portability.

Here's a proposal for thread organization.

Single processor mode has three threads:  a GUI thread, a back-end
thread, and a communication thread.

Dual processor mode has two processes and four threads:
processor 1 has the GUI thread and a communication thread, and
processor 2 has the back-end thread and a communication thread.

The GUI and back-end threads are the same in both cases.  They ask the
communication threads for things (mostly the location of data) and the
communication thread tells them where the data is.  The single
processor communication thread doesn't have to do much -- just tell
one thread where the data lives in the other thread, and lock and
unlock the data as appropriate.  The double processor communication
threads will have to arrange for the transfer of data between
processors.

Does this make any sense?  Should it be implemented with MPI?  Do
threads automatically run on separate processors on a multiprocessor
machine, or do we have to do something special to take advantage of
shared memory with multiple cpus?

If we do this, the first thing to work out will have to be the language
(messages? objects?) that the threads will use to talk to one another.


FRONT END -- touchy feely stuff

* Sends python commands to back end 
     Eg, Create mesh, read mesh, define material, define/activate field,
       equilibrate, etc.
     Has to assign python variable names to use in back end.
* Asks back end for values (where is output chain evaluated?)
* Knows current state of Fields, Equations, and Fluxes, Boundary conditions

THINGS FRONT END SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO WHILE BACK END IS BUSY

* Provide information about which problem is being solved
* Switch between displays
* Scroll graphics window
* Set up another problem
      Does front end know all about Properties? Can it tell if a
      Material definition is consistent?
* Interrupt the back end
* Launch another back end?

BACK END -- memory and cpu intensive stuff

* Knows what Materials are defined.
* Knows current state of Fields, Equations, and Fluxes
* Can change current state of Fluxes, in response to changes in
  Fields, Equations, and Materials.
* Equilibrates mesh, does all the hard work.
* Returns requested data to front end

Actually, there should be two back end threads, at times.  After dof
and nodaleqn values are copied into vector of unknowns and rhs, and
before they're copied back into the nodes, a separate thread should
construct the stiffness matrix and do the equilibration.  This leaves
the main thread free to respond to front end requests for data,
compute outputs, etc.

----

Contour plotting:

1. Output object evaluates functions at FuncNodes.
2. Display object gets the positions and values from the Output
   object.
3. Display object sets contour levels.
4. Display object asks each Element to provide a polygon for each
   interval between contour levels.  It will have to pass the contour
   levels and the Output values to the Element.


-----
  Body forces:

The property/field/equation set has been modified to incorporate
a new, and rather unusual, sort of body force, which merits
some discussion.

  The need arose from the desire to put an offset temperature T0 into
the thermal-expansion property -- a finite temperature at which a
particular stress-free strain is specified.  By virtue of the elastic
linearity, it is possible to express this in terms of a "body stress"
which is imposed over all of the elements having a material with the
given property.

The existing body-force mechanism, designed around the early
mass-density example, is designed to write to the right-hand side of
the equation directly, in terms of the divergence of the flux to which
the equation applies.  Stresses do not do this -- in fact, in the
usual formulation of the problem, a constant offset stress does not
enter in at all, but only shows up by virtue of its divergences, in
the right-hand side.

What has been put in is a mechanism which accomplishes this,
automatically, and allows the property to express things in terms of a
"background" (or "external") stress field directly.  In the
integrated-by-parts formulation of the problem, it's possible to
meaningfully integrate an arbitrary stress field, without worrying too
much about its properties.  If constant, the stress field will not
contribute, because the integral of the gradients of the shape
functions, over the lattice, will be zero.  Doing the volume
integration will generate right-hand side contributions which are
equal to what you would have gotten if you had imposed a force
boundary condition on the boundary of the region with the stress.
However, for complex boundaries, this may be hard to compute, and the
body integral method has the advantage of being automatically correct
for arbitrarily complex shapes, applicable for the more general case
of a spatially varying stress, and expressed naturally in terms of the
physical ingredients of the problem.

The down-side of this approach is that, for what may be presumed to be
the usual uniform case, the computation is quite inefficient -- you go
to a lot of effort to compute zero at all the interior nodes.  Also,
there is an inherent risk of computing zero in a complicated way,
namely that the fractional error you make due to roundoff will always
be very large, though the absolute error may be small.  "Noise" forces
in the right-hand side may also complicate the solver's job, by giving
the appearnce of fully populating the right-hand side.


-------
Errors in Python Callbacks:
 
  An unfortunate typo lead to a hard-to-diagnose problem in a Python
callback routine, specifically the TestProperty's fluxmatrix routine.
It was getting a simple NameError, but the actual behavior was that
the routine was bailing out at a hard-to-determine point in the
routine, and returning NULL to the enclosing C++ PyEval_CallObject.

  It is possible for C++ to notice the exception condition by detecting
the NULLness of the return value, and to retrieve a PyObject*
corresponding to the exception by calling PyErr_Occurred(), but it's
not (yet) obvious how to parse the Python error in C++ in order to
generate a coherent message for the user.  Since fluxmatrix runs code
which is very close to the user, coherence of error messages is quite
important.

  Solution: C++ does not need to parse the Python error at all.  Since
the Python error indicator has already been set, all that has to
happen is that NULL be returned to the Python caller.  The new trivial
exception class "PythonError" does this, when caught in the global
exception typemap it simply returns NULL.  Python handles the rest.


------------
GUI issues:

  A logical "shadow" structure has been constructed, starting in the
file GUI/oofGUI.py, which contains all the callback routines.  The
Glade connect/listener scheme is not used.  

  A handy thing in a lot of GUIs is the ability to right-click 
on things and have useful stuff happen.  It would be nice if the 
OOF2 GUI did this also.  This is a secondary consideration beyond
basic correct functionality, of course, which is why it's here in
the NOTES file.  So I won't forget. 

  Also:

  There is an ambiguity in the assignment of properties to mateials
regarding ownership -- users will want to be able to edit the
parameters of properties loaded in from libraries, as well as those
which are present in the property tree.  But materials may also want
to reference external properties, if for instance if a user wishes to
conveniently change the orientation of a lot of otherwise diverse
properties.  This suggests that besides owning properties, materials
may sometimes want to reference properties.

  The solution to this is to explicitly add "linking" as an operation
which can relate a material and a property, resolving the ambiguities.
If a property is linked to a material, then that property remains
owned by the property tree.  If the material is saved, it only saves
the link, and cannot be actually used outside of a context in which
the linked-to property is known.  If, on the other hand, a property is
loaded into a material, the material acquires ownership, and changes
to the parameters made when the property is selected via the material
list have no effect on properties in the property tree.

  At solution-time, the GUI will know which properties are referenced,
and will be able to instantiate them, with automatically-generated
variable names, outside of any material so that references to them
from inside many materials will all work.  The GUI will, furthermore,
allow users to build incomplete materials if they want to, for
debugging purposes or whatever.  Such materials will generate errors
at solution-time, but these errors should be comprehensible.
Continuously enforcing a completeness requirement for materials is a
practical impossibility, since any material must necessarily pass
through incomplete states somewhere between initial definition and
complete construction.

  It would be helpful if linked vs. copied materials were visually
distinguished in the GUI, by italics or boldface or whatever.
Likewise, uninstantiated properties and named properties in the
property tree ought to be distinguishable in this way.

  Within this scheme, there remain some ambiguities.  If a user imports
a material which defines a named property, and it is distinct from a
property of the same name in the property tree, then any future
reference to the name is ambiguous.  This situation can be detected at
load-time, and the user can be queried as to his or her intentions.
Alternatively, users may wish to eliminate the query by selecting
default behavior in a hypothetical OOF user-configuration file.

  At the level of the GUI code, there is a useful distinction to be made
between "Property" in the sense of a C++/Python class, and "Property"
in the sense of a bunch of parameters which map fields to fluxes.  The
former I have been calling "Constituve rules", and the latter are what
is physically meant by a "Property", although to avoid ambiguity I
prefer to call them "parametrizations" or "instantiations".

  The shadow objects associated with properties need to know a number of
things: They need to know their names, they need to have a list of
parameter input widgets which can be put up in the GUI window, they
need to know whether or not they have been instantiated, and they
might want to know who their owner is.  They also need to know what
sort of property they are, to prevent, for instance, a material from
having more than one sort of elasticity.  They should be able to
generate an instance of the corresponding property, probably by
emitting the text of the appropriate constructor.  Constructors should
have keyword arguments, and when there is a choice, the emitted
constructor should use the same parametrization as was selected in the
GUI, i.e., if one user enters isotropic elasticity in terms of lambda
and mu, the emitted constructor should use lambda and mu, but if
another user enters the parameters in terms of Young modulus and
Poisson ratio, then the emitted constructor should use those.
This makes the resulting text file more readable for a user who
wishes to modify it.


======
  Right-clicks:  There are a couple of different "levels" of signals
in the GTK+ world.  To find out about right-clicks and double-clicks,
you should create a callback handler for "button_press_event", which 
takes as arguments the GTK+ object generating the event, the event
itself (as a GdkEvent), and whatever extra data you pass through,
same as other signal-handler callbacks.  The event has a "state"
attribute which can be queried to find out what, if any, modifiers
were present when the button was pressed, and furthermore has a 
"button" attribute, which is an integer corresponding to the number
of the button.  A button-number of three indicates a right-click,
and an event.type of "_2BUTTON_PRESS" indicates a double-click.
There is also a triple-click, but I can't imagine that being useful.

Parametrization class

For specifying values for parameters that can be parametrized in
various ways.  Eg, RBG, HSV, grayvalue for Color, or Cijkl or
lambda,mu for isotropic elasticity.

A Parametrization contains
  a name
  a list of strings identifying each possible parametrization
  lists of variable names for each parametrization
  an int or string indicating which parametrization was used to initialize it
  routines that return the current value in a given parametrization
  routine that returns a widget for the gui

The Parametrization is the basic stateful object for properties 
in the GUI.  Input widgets ask the parametrization for data,
and give user-supplied data back to the parametrization.
When it comes time to build the property, the arguments to the 
constructor are actually provided by the parametrization.
  This way, it becomes possible to parametrize properties using
the same scheme in the absence of the GUI.

  Unsolved question:  How to achieve the required context-sensitivity,
so that a fourth-rank symmetric tensor parametrizer knows whether or
not to provide conventional names for elasticity (lambda, mu, E, nu, etc.),
and when not to, e.g. when parametrizing the fourth-rank tensor which
maps from strawberry fields to capacitor flux.
