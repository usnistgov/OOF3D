Output chains:
  * Determine what is plotted.
  * Don't determine how it's plotted, or where.
  * May produce scalar, vector, or tensor quantities. (?)
  * May produce quantities that are meaningful at arbitrary points (eg
    stress), on Elements (eg, ColorProperty or other Material
    parameters), or on Nodes (eg, nodal forces).

Device:
  * Postscript or screen.
  * Perhaps a toolkit canvas is the only device we need, if it can
    produce postscript output. 
  * Has to understand some simple language of primitive graphics
    operations:
       boundingbox(Coord, Coord) determines coordinate system & clipping  NO
       segment(Coord, Coord)
       segments([Coord, Coord])     ([] ==> List)
       curve([Coord])                connected segments
       polygon([Coord])              closed curve    
       linewidth(double)             in same units as coordinates!
       linecolor(Color)
       fillcolor(Color)
       circle(Coord, double)
       label(string, Coord, direction)
       font(Font, size)
       colormap(ColorMap)            maps [0,1] to RGB
       clear()  indicates beginning of new data set
       show()   indicates end of data set
  * Determines range of data, bounding box, by examining data itself.

DisplayMethod:
  * Edges only, edges+fill, contours, filled contours, vectors, etc.
  * Intermediates between output chains and device.
  * Has two output chains as its input: one for positions of nodes and one
    for displayed values.  The second one is optional.
  * Output type for displayed values must be compatible with Display
    method.  Eg, Contour Display can only be used with scalar Output.
  * Determines at which coordinates the output chains need to be
    evaluated.
  * Tells device the coordinate system and bounding box, but device
    determines the visible region.  Display can ask device for visible
    region.  NO -- just sends data, and lets device worry about what's
    visible.
  * Can ask device about resolution, so as to avoid placing output
    points too close together.  NO
  
Display:
 * A list of DisplayMethods, all being overlaid on the same
   Device.
 * The list is ordered, so that later objects appear on top of earlier
   ones.

Procedure:
  * Device defaults to canvas, when using GUI, or PostScript, when not.
  * User specifies Output chains.
  * User selects Display method from set compatible with Output chain.
  * Display method chooses evaluation points.
  * Display asks Elements for appropriate evaluation points, if
    necessary.
  * Display passes evaluation points through Output chain to get
    positions and values.
  * Display asks Elements to post-process values, if necessary.  For
    example, a Contour display has to pass nodal values and contour
    levels back to Elements to get contours.
  * Display sends plotting commands to Device.


  * GUI creates Device
  * GUI creates Output chains and calls Display(outputs, device)
  * Display is listed in list of all Displays (list is in Mesh?
      Someone else has a list of (Mesh, [Display]) assignments?)
  * When mesh is updated, all Displays redraw.

    Display.draw()
    Display.draw(other_device)
    Display.close()   removes self from list of all Displays


Random Thoughts & Concerns

 * One Output may be shared by many DisplayMethods belonging to one or
   more Displays.  How can we avoid recomputing the Output?  Can we?
   The DisplayMethods may require values of the Output at different
   points.  Should there be an OutputLocation class that determines
   where outputs will be evaluated?  (ElementCenter, ElementNodes,
   ElementGaussPoints, ElementAnyWhere, etc.)  Each DisplayMethod
   would have an associated OutputLocation.  The Display could see if
   any of its DisplayMethods shared the same Output and
   OutputLocation, and arrange to cache the data.

   Some DisplayMethods, such as Contour, will have to evaluate the
   Output at additional points, not determined ahead of time.  The
   values at these points probably can't be cached.

   This may fall into the category of Optimizations to be Put Off
   until Later.

 * Types:  It's insufficient to use type() to see if a parameter or
   Output result is the right type, since type(Color) = type(Mesh) =
   InstanceType.  But it would be unfortunate to use object.__class__
   (for InstanceTypes), since we could have more than one class that
   can serve in any given role.  (For example, there's the Coord class
   defined in C++ and swigged, and the Point class defined in Python
   in IO/primitives.py for cases where the C++ calling overhead isn't
   necessary.  The output routines don't care if they're getting a
   Coord or a Point.)   We could just say that we will require certain
   types, and make sure that all parameters and outputs are at least
   derived from the expected type.  We could offer more than one
   choice, so that we can allow either Point and Coord, for example.

 * Parameters:  DisplayMethods will require parameters of specific
   types, much as the Outputs do.  They should share the same
   mechanism.  Perhaps there should be a ParametrizedObject class,
   from which Output and DisplayMethod can both be derived.  (It's
   tempting to think that DisplayMethod is just another Output, but
   it's not.  DisplayMethods talk to Devices, and Outputs don't.
   Outputs can be chained, and DisplayMethods can't.)
