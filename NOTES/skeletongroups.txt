Subproblems, internal boundaries, and the locations of surface
properties can be specified by providing element groups or segment groups.

Element groups can be specified by boolean combinations of the
following sets:

     1) All elements

     2) Selected elements

     3) Material name [is | contains | begins with | ends with] <string>

     4) Material contains Property whose name
		 [is | contains | begins with | ends with] <string>

     5) Dominant pixel is in PixelGroup whose name
		 [is | contains | begins with | ends with] <string>

     6) Dominant pixel has color <Color> in image <Image>

     7) Homogeneity is [less | greater] than <value>.

     8) ???
   
Definitions 3-? are *dynamic*.  If the Microstructure or Image
changes, so do the element groups.  The groups definitions can be
stored abstractly and only converted into lists of Elements when
necessary.

Dynamic rules can be specified when a group is created.  We may want
to keep a clear distinction between dynamic and static groups, making
it impossible to add elements by hand to a dynamic group.


Segment groups can be specified by boolean combinations of:

    1) All segments

    2) Selected segments

    3) Segments bounding element group whose name
          [is | contains | begins with | ends with] <string>

    4) Segments of elements whose Material name
          [is | contains | begins with | ends with] <string> 

    5) ???

Again, definitions 3-? are dynamic.  A group created with the boolean
'and' of two definition 3s will contain only the segments shared by
the two element groups.  Definition 4 and other similar to it aren't
strictly necessary, since they can be written in terms of definition 3
and an element group definition.


Node groups could be treated similarly.
