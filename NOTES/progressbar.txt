# Thoughts on a new ProgressBar class

# The main problem with the old class is that there's no way to have
# more than one progress bar for a thread.  For timestepping, we need
# multiple bars -- overall progress towards the target time, stiffness
# matrix construction, matrix solution, and possibly non-linear
# convergence.  This requires major reworking of the progress bar class,
# so we should also take the opportunity to simplify the API, which is a
# bit of a mess.

# Requirements:

# Split into back end and front end (gui) classes.  Back end can exist
# independently of front end.  Back end should be C++. Front end
# should be Python.

# Independent of threads.  The task associated with one progress bar
# might be distributed over many threads, or one thread may be peforming
# tasks associated with many progress bars.

# Hierarchical.  One task can have subtasks that display their own
# progress bars.  Only the top bar in the hierarchy has a stop button.
# Pressing the stop button stops all tasks in the hierarchy. 

# Need a master ProgressBarManager object that keeps track of which
# Progress objects and ProgressBars are still active, and destroys
# those that aren't needed anymore.  If there's no GUI

# Pseudocode snippets:

enum ProgressBarType:  
     Activity   # Just indicates that something is happening
     Fractional # Measures progress towards a goal

# Back end classes

# These should actually be implemented in C++ so that C++ code can
# report its progress with little overhead.
