Encapsulate Field data (defined_index, etc) into a FieldData struct,
and store a vector<FieldData*> in Mesh.  DONE

Mesh destructor should delete all Elements, Nodes, and FieldDatas.

Python should maintain a list of all Materials.

After reading a data file, all new Materials should be
cross_reference()d automatically.  DONE

Each Material should have a bool xrefd flag which is set when
cross_reference() is called, and unset when AddProperty() is called.
NOT DONE, but shouldn't be... Python material operations take care of
calling cross_reference when it's needed.

Before cross referencing, any previous cross referencing must be
forgotten.  This allows new Properties to be added to a previously
used Material.  DONE

When adding nodes *after* fields are defined, make sure that doflist
is allocated correctly.  DONE

Fix area calculation:  testbdy -n 3 -b -q  DONE

Are DoF's being created at mapping nodes for superparametric elements?
They shouldn't be...

Optimization:  All elements compute their area by integrating. 
Simple elements should override and do it more efficiently.
--> comment moved to OPTIMIZATION file.

Element repr strings not set for most (all?) elements.
Should be constructable?

Double-check about const-ifying nodes in the Element class,
do it if possible.  Ditto for BCs.


Fix the NodeIterator and FuncNodeIterator.  The NodeIterator used to
loop over all of the nodes in the Mesh, but that was before FuncNodes
were derived from Nodes.  Now there needs to be a FuncNodeIterator (or
some other way of accessing all of the FuncNodes), but it's hard to do
because the Mesh stores all of the Nodes in one list.

Element::builder functions use dynamic_cast<>s to convert Node* to
FuncNode*.  This is ugly.  Can it be done better?

In ghostmesh, when creating real elements, is it faster to remove
edges from the dictionary after they've been used?  That will keep the
dictionary small, and maybe make it faster to use.  But there will be
some overhead in removing edges.  
  If so, the remaining edges in the dictionary will be the boundary
of the system itself, i.e. all edges which are not shared.  Is this
a useful object? 
  ANSWER:  The two techniques are indistinguishable on the basis 
of speed for up to 100x100 meshes, and I (AR) can't think of a 
good use for the leftover data.  Currently set to delete edges
when finished with them, ergo DONE.


In the Node** global typemap (in oof.swg), once we're satisfied the
scheme works, change PyList_GetItem to the faster, non-error-checked
macro PyList_GET_ITEM.
Anywhere else?  Yes, both of them "SetItem."  One occurrence in each
of boundary.swg and elementreg.swg.  Grep says no occurrences of
"GetItem" in any .swg file.
DONE

Boundary conditions:  There are an increasing number of places
where boundary conditions should throw exceptions, but instead
fail silently -- flux BC's do this in the Python callback, if
they get the wrong thing, for instance.  Related:  FluxBC's
don't check if their flux is active; Fixed/Float BC's don't
check to see if their field is defined/active.  They should.

Also, if you ask for a non-existent component of a nodal 
equation, it dumps core -- this would be another good place
for some kind of sensible exception.  Also for DOF. 
Probably lots of other places too.

Flux boundary conditions:  Can only specify the flux in the 
lab frame, should be able to specify it in the normal frame also.
  DONE.

CornerNodeIterator

Should be able to add an integer to all ElementNodeIterators to get
another ElementNodeIterator of the same subclass.  Should wrap around
properly.  DONE

Output:

  An efficient and structured output scheme could work 
as follows.  The goal is to get the value of a field
at a point.
 1: Python will call an edge or element method, with a field and
    a list of indices which can be converted to MasterCoords
    (or possibly Coords.)
 2: The element or edge will ask the field for its field iterator,
    and use it to iterate over components.  For each component,
    it will ask a field evaluation routine for the scalar value 
    of that component at a given Coord or MasterCoord.
 3: The passed-back result will be a tuple of tuples.  The outermost
    tuple will have one entry for each passed-in index.  These items
    will be tuples of scalars representing each of the components 
    of the evaluated field.  They are guaranteed to be in iterator order.
 4: If, later on, one of the Python Output classes needs to do 
    something complicated (e.g. compute the local principal axes of a 
    symmetric tensor field) it can use the field iterator to establish
    a correspondence between the values in the tuple and any higher
    order structure.  

    New routines required:  A field evaluation routine that takes
    an element, an integer component, and a MasterCoord or Coord,
    and does the actual interpolation on the element.=======

Done for edges.
---

Check that all operator='s return a reference, not a const reference.
Same for operator*=, etc.   DONE


Add ability to fix components of a field at individual nodes,
to de-singularize matrices.  This will work like a fixed boundary 
condition at the application level.  DONE


Deal with NaN's in the preconditioners for singular matrices. 
These arise from a divide-by-zero that occurs at construction-time,
so it's a danger even if the preconditioner is not used. 
  What is additionally confusing is that not every singular
matrix gives rise to this behavior, e.g. two-floating-BC
isoparametric meshes larger than 1 don't seem to show this
problem.  Status:  Added to ilupre_double.C
                   Added to icpre_double.C also, apparently on May 16.


---

The Mesh.node_iterator should use the same trick that
Material.fetchProperty uses to return derived types to Python.  Then
there'd be no need for ErrNotAFuncNode.  DONE via PythonExportable class.

---

In problem.py, why do we need to tell forcebalance_eqn about
stress_flux in both the DivergenceEquation constructor and in
uses_flux()?  WE DON'T.  FIXED

---

Is Node::displaced_position() archaic and vestigial?

---

In property class hierarchy, the "ThermalExpansion" property 
currently does nothing with respect to orientation.  This is 
because orientation is expected to be redone so that some
materials can have local (or locally-varying?) orientations.
Orientation-sensitivity should be added to this class at
that time.

Investigate mysterious slow-down in heterogeneous systems, 
e.g. in testbodyforce.py, when the bottom boundary is fixed,
the top only has the weight of the heavy material on it, there
are no other BC's applied, you are using subparametric elements,
and the ratio between the elastic constants of the heavy vs.
massless material is more than 100:1, equilibration begins to
require many thousands of iterations.
  Discovery:  This is only true for the GMRES solver, which 
seems to be quite sensitive to matrix quality.  BiCG can 
solve the foregoing case, at 1000:1 heterogeneity for a 3x4
mesh (the defaults for testbodyforce) in 32 iterations.
These are the only two solvers tried so far.
  Further info:  Additional experimentation indicates that the
GMRES solver is generally poorly behaved for matrices which are
column-permutations of symmetric matrices.  

---
  
  Figure out how to handle exceptions raised inside of Python
callbacks.  See the discussion in NOTES.  DONE.

---

Fix comments re elmdict in ghostmesh.py.  They describe an obsolete
mechanism.

---
System stuff:
 
  Move correct configure script to the OOF2 directory of the source
tree before releasing the thing.  Modify configure script to fail
if SWIG is not present, or alternatively, include SWIG-generated
files in the "source" distribution, as we are already doing with
glade.
