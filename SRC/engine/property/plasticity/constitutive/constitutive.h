// Constitutive rules for plasticity. Base class knows that there are
// Schmid tensors, can add and remove plastic data from the elements.
// The specifics of what the plastic data actually contains and what
// it means, dynamically speaking, is up to the subclasses.

// Every constitutive rule has some number of slip systems, set by the
// containing plasticity property, which knows the crystallography.

// constitutive rule, so it's not special to any particular one.  The
