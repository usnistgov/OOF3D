  OOF2 Property Constructor's Guide
  =================================

  One of the major goals of the OOF2 project is to provide a
finite-element framework with "pluggable physics" -- constitutive
rules which govern the behavior of materials are modular, and
reasonably self-contained, so that users with sufficient coding
ability can write their own new properties, either in C++ or 
in Python.

  This document describes how to write a new property class for OOF2.

  
  What Properties Must Do
  -----------------------

  From a computational point of view, the fundamental role of an OOF2
property is to provide a mechanism for relating fields -- the degrees
of freedom of the model system -- to fluxes, quantities whose
divergences correspond to generalized forces.  In OOF2, several
properties which contribute to the same flux are grouped into equation
objects, which manage the contributions from each of the properties,
and the set of equations is then used to construct the master
stiffness matrix.  The system is designed to be modular in such a way
that properties only need to know how to make their own contribution
to the appropriate flux.  Provided properties do this correctly, and
adhere to the API, the OOF2 system can handle all of the other levels
of abstraction, including the construction of equations, the
application of boundary conditions and so forth.


  Property Registration Requirements
  ----------------------------------

  In OOF2, a property object is an instance of a class which is a
subclass, either directly or through an inheritance chain, of the C++
"Property" class.  Properties written in Python must descend from the
PyPropertyWrapper class, which exposes the Property interface to
Python through SWIG, and is itself a subclass of Property.

  There are a number of bookkeeping capabilities that property objects
must have, in order to behave correctly as members of a Material
object.  Each time a property is added to, or removed from, a
material, that material then iterates through all of its member
properties, calling all of their "registr" routines (so named because
the more obvious "register" is a reserved word in C++), and on
completion, looping through them all again calling their
"cross_reference" routines.
 
  Properties must provide a "registr" function, and if they require the
cooperation of other properties, should extract pointers to those
properties in the "cross_reference" function.

  The property "registr" function achieves its goal principally by
calling other, more "atomic" registration functions in other objects.
It takes as an argument the material undertaking the registration.
Properties indicate their type and the flux to which they contribute
by calling the argument's "registr" function with themselves and
either a string indicating their type, or a flux object to which they
contribute, as arguments.  The function indicates which fields are
required to compute the property in question require by calling that
field's "registr" function with a pointer to themselves as an object.

  The property cross_reference function is called after all of a
material's property's registr functions have completed.  At this
point, the property can retrieve pointers to other properties by
calling the host material's fetchProperty routine with the appropriate
string argument.  If the corresponding material has registered itself
correctly, it will be retrieved by this means.  This mechanism should
be used, for instance, by non-elastic properties to get access to the
elastic constants.

  These routines have to be supplied somewhere in the set of classes
above the actual property instance, somewhere below the Property base
class itself.  It is sensible to group properites with similar
registration requirements into class hierarchies headed by a class
which hosts a common "registr" function, providing the functionality
exactly once at the appropriate level.  For example, all elasticity
properties in the base version of OOF2 descend from an "Elasticity"
class, which has a registr routine which notes that elasticity
requires a displacement field, contributes to the stress flux, and
should be referred to by other properties as "Elasticity".

**EXAMPLE

  For Python properties, the coding logistics are slightly different --
these properties must provide a list of fields and fluxes and a string
to the PyPropertyWrapper's Python init.  The PyPropertyWrapper stores
this data, and hosts a "registr" function which then uses the data to
inform the host material about required fields, contributed fluxes,
and the property type.

**EXAMPLE

  Sequence of Events
  ------------------

  Once a property is registered and cross-referenced, it is ready to be
called by the solver to provide numerical values for its contributions
to the fluxes.  The solver will call each of several entry points a
number of times as it iterates through the equations and elements
which make up the mesh.  All of these calls are present as virtual
functions in the base Property class, and so need not be provided by
every property unless it makes sense to do so.

  The first property entry point called in the process of constructing
the master stiffness matrix is the precompute routine.  It gets called
from Material::precompute_all, which in turn is called from
Mesh::make_stiffness.  There are no arguments.  This call provides the
property with the opportunity to complete any high-overhead
computations which could not be completed earlier, but which are too
expensive to repeat element-by-element or node-by-node.  The canonical
example is for anisotropic properties to use this call to multiply
their coefficient matrices by their material's orientation matrix.
The material editor ensures that property instances are not shared
between materials, so you can be assured that this routine will only
be called once for a given equilibration.

  Once the precomputations are complete, the main stiffness-matrix
construction loop begins iterating over elements in the mesh.  There
is at most one material per element.  For each element, the
corresponding material notifies each of its properties that an element
computation has begin by calling the property's begin_element()
routine with a pointer to the current element as an argument.  There
is a corresponding end_element() call, also with the element as an
argument, which is called when the element computation has been
completed.

  The solver's next task is to decide how many integration points to use
in the element, for which it needs to know the polynomial order of the
expression being integrated.  This is handled in the material's
make_stiffness routine, which is called by Element::make_stiffness.
For each flux which is contributed to by properties in this material
(which is known from the registration data provided by the
properties), there is a list of properties which contribute.  For each
such property, a call is made to that property's K_integration_order
routine, with the polynomial order of the shape functions passed in as
an argument.  This function should return an integer equal to the sum
of the argument and the polynomial order of the computation being
made.  If the property's contribution to the flux is quadratic in the
fields, for example, and the element has shape functions of degree
two, the polynomial order of the resulting computation is four, and
this is what the K_integration_order routine should return.  The
material will provide enough integration points for the largest
polynomial order it encounters among the fluxes and properties.

  At this point, the main property computation can begin.

  Each flux in the material will, for each integration point in an
element, construct for itself a local matrix and a local vector to
which the property should make its contributions.  They are called the
"flux matrix" and the "flux offset".  The rows of the matrix are
indexed by the components of the equations which contain the flux, and
are eventually mapped to rows of the master stiffness matrix.  The
columns of the matrix are indexed by all the degrees of freedom in the
current element, which is to say, there is one column per component of
an active field per function-interpolation node.

  The property makes its contribution to this flux matrix in its
fluxmatrix routine.  This routine takes as arguments a mesh, an
element, an ElementFuncNodeIterator object which indicates which node
in the element is current, a pointer to the flux, and an integration
point.  The property can use the ElementFuncNodeIterator to evaluate
the shape functions within the element at the indicated point by
calling the .shapefunction method with the current point as an
argument.  Derivatives of the shape functions are also available.  The
property should then iterate over the components of the flux to which
it contributes, and make contributions to the appropriate matrix
element, which can be retrieved (in reference form) by calling the
flux's matrix_element method with, in order, the mesh, the index of
the flux component, the field, the field component, and the
ElementFuncNodeIterator reference.  The flux will use the flux
component to find the row, and the field, field component, and
ElementFuncNodeIterator to determine the column.

  A similar scheme is used if the property needs to make contributions
to the right-hand-side of the master stiffness matrix system.  The
property must provide a "fluxrhs" routine, which takes as arguments
the mesh, the element, the flux, and the integration point.  This is
useful for properties which make non-field-dependent contributions
directly to the values of the flux.  An example of this is thermal
expansion, where a temperature-dependent offset must be added to the
stress in order to provide for the correct stress-free strain.  Such
properties should make their contributions to the appropriate
"offset_element", retrieved from the flux by specifying the mesh and
the flux index to the offset_element method.

  It may also happen that a property makes direct contributions not to
the flux, but to its divergence.  Such "body force" contributions also
occur in the fluxrhs routine, but in this case, rather than retrieving
the offset_element, the property should retrieve and write to the
"rhs_element" method, again specifying the index, and keeping in mind
that the dimensionality of this vector is that of the *divergence* of
the flux, not the flux itself.
 
  After each element has been completed, and all the gauss points have
been passed in to fluxmatrix and fluxrhs, the property's "element_end"
entry point is called, with the element as an argument.  Properties
can clean up storage space used or intermediate results computed in
the process of making the field-to-flux mapping.

  Note that the property itself does not do any of the integration.  It
need not (must not!) apply any weighting coefficients or do any other
processing other than computing the local contribution to the flux at
a given point.  Integration, along with matrix construction,
constraint resolution and the application of boundary conditions, is
the responsibility of the solver.  If you find you want to make
changes to these portions of the code, the right way to do that would
be to examine the solver code itself, rather than trying to sneak the
desired effects in via the property API.

  Currently, the solution calls do not make any particular effort to
identify the location in space of a given integration point.  The
position passed to the fluxmatrix and fluxrhs routines is in the
element's master space.  Inhomogeneous properties which want to know
their location in the system should not use the element's shape
functions, because their host element may not be isoparametric, but
should instead call the element's from_master method, with the
integration point in master space as an argument, to find their
location in the system.

  Properties written in Python have the same behavior and obey the same
API as described above.  The Python class representing a property
should descend from the PyPropertyWrapper class.  It must provide the
same functions, with the same arguments, as the C properties.


  SWIG Shadow Objects for Properties
  -----------------------------------

  C++ properties have to be visible to Python, and so should be SWIG'd.
The constructor should be accessible, and the shadow class should have
a __repr__ function which returns a string which, when executed, calls
the registraiton object's __call__ method.  The __repr__ will, of
course, require access to the property's internal parameter values.
It is most sensible forproperties to also provide access to the
parameters separately, and to have the __repr__ function use these
parameter-extraction functions to build its return string.  There is
no formal requirement in the API for extraction of individual
parameters, but such a thing is not out of the question in future
versions.


  PropertyRegistration Objects
  ----------------------------

  In order to be operated correctly by the user interface, every
property imported into OOF2 must create a PropertyRegistration object
at import time.  The PropertyRegistration object will create actual
instances of the property at run-time by calling the constructor.  The
PropertyRegistration is a vital component of a Property object.  It
allows your property to accept parameter values either from the GUI or
from script or menu commands, and by inserting itself into the OOF
namespace under a name which you provide, controls the "public face"
of your property.  For C++ properties, this command must be in the
"_.py" file corresponding to the property module.

  The PropertyRegistration object created at import-time should also be
assigned to a key in the property manager, which is available under
the name "AllPropreties".  By making this assignment, you place your
property in the property tree, making it visible to the GUI.  The key
is a string consisting of colon-separated names, the last of which
should be the same as the public name of your property.

  The general format of this assignment is:

AllProperties['Head:Middle:Public_name'] =
    PropertyRegistration('Public_name', ActualClassName,
                         'fully.qualified.module.name',
			 <ordering>, params=[...])

  ... where Public_name is the string presented in the tree, and the
name representing your property in the scripting namespace,
ActualClassName is the name of the class defined in the file,
fully.qualified.module.name is the dot-separated path to the file's
location in the source tree, starting from the first directory below
OOF2/SRC (this should be "engine"), <ordering> is some integer, and
the right side of the params assignment is a list of parameters your
property expects in its constructor, in the correct order.

  OOF2 includes code templates for properties, both for Python and C++.
Users are encouraged to consult these templates.  Users may also find
it helpful to read the following section, which documents the
structure of the PropertyRegistration class.



 
  Property Management and the PropertyRegistration Class
  ======================================================

  Because of the special behavior of properties in OOF, their
registration objects are highly customized.  The departures from
default behavior revolve around the specialness of names in the
property class.  PropertyRegistration objects do not generally present
their "name" field as a parameter to the GUI, nor do they expect to
receive a name with parameter values passed in to the
"OOF.Property.Parametrize..." menu tree.  The name of a property
object is implicit in its location in the tree.  However, it is still
possible to create a named property (as from a script, for instance)
by calling an unnamed property's PropertyRegistration's __call__
method, which *can* take a name as a parameter.  If such an object
receives a name, it will not set its own name parameter, but will
instead create a NamedPropertyRegistration object from itself, and set
the new object's name parameter, and at the same time, automatically
add the object to the menu tree and the GUI, if present.

  So, for example, given a starting point for which there is no instance
of the property "Verisimilitude" named "truth", both of the following
sets of operations will create one with the parameter "veracity" set
to 1.  The first would be what would appear in a log file as a result
of typical GUI operations to set up such a property.  The second would
be the result of saving the property to a file.

# Create via menu ops.
OOF.Property.Select(propname="Unphysical:Versimilitude")
OOF.Property.New(propname="truth") # Operates on current selection.
OOF.Property.Parametrize.Unphysical.Versimilitude.truth(veracity=1)

# Create by calling the PropertyRegistrations' __call__.
Verisimilitude(name="truth", veracity=1)


  Additional discussion of the PropertyRegistration object and its
mechanics is contained in the materialeditor documentation.
