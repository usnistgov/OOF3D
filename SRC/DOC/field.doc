Here's a summary of the way the field classes work, and how
they interact with the DegreeOfFreedom and Node classes.

Basics

The value of a field (eg temperature or displacement) at a
point is stored as a DegreeOfFreedom at a Node.  Each Node has a list
(vector<DegreeOfFreedom*> Node::doflist) of field values.  The Field
classes are used to extract the value of the field from the list of
degrees of freedom at a Node, using Field::operator()(const Node*)
or Field::operator()(const ElementNodeIterator&). [ElementNodeIterator
is a class that's used to loop over all the Nodes belonging to an
Element.]

There are different kinds of fields (ScalarField, TwoVectorField,
etc), and the type returned by Field::operator() depends on the
derived type of the Field.  But since sometimes we need to use a Field
through a pointer to the Field base class, we need to also have a
virtual function that returns a double.  I assume that all Field
components can be indexed by an integer, and so there's an operator
virtual DegreeOfFreedom *operator()(const Node*, int component).  For
ScalarField the component is meaningless. (If we ever have a
TensorField we'll need either to use a FieldIndex class heirarchy
instead of an int for the component number, or we'll need a scheme for
indexing a tensor by a single int.)

Helper classes

For nonscalar fields, it's nice to be able to treat their values at
Nodes as compound objects, even though they are actually stored as
individual DegreeOfFreedom objects. So Fields like TwoVectorField have
associated Helper classes that return an intermediate object which
handles the conversion to the appropriate type. The Helper class
should never have to be explicitly used.

Examples:
  Node *node = ...;
  extern ScalarField temperature;    // defined in problems.h
  temperature(node)->value() = 273;  // assign value to T at this node
     // temperature(node) is a DegreeOfFreedom*
  Field *T = &temperature;           // pointer to base class
  (*T)(node, 0)->value() = 273;      // have to use fake component index

  int globalindex = temperature(node)->dofindex();  // position in matrix
     // temperature(node) is a DegreeOfFreedom*

  extern TwoVectorField displacement;  // defined in problems.h
  Coord disp;  // a two component vector
  displacement(node) = disp; // uses TwoVectorHelper class
        // displacement(node) is a TwoVectorHelper
  displacement(node, 0)->value() = disp[0]; // an equivalent way of doing it
  displacement(node, 1)->value() = disp[1]; //    using the DoF explicitly.

Defined and Active Fields

The Field objects themselves are global static objects, constructed
when the program is initialized. (Actually they're in the OOFproblem
namespace.)  Since they don't take up much memory, there's no problem
with having them always there.  If the nodes are storing values for
the Fields, the fields are said to be "defined", and the fields have
virtual functions Field::define() and Field::undefine().  These
functions allocate space for the DegreeOfFreedoms in the Nodes.
Fields that are being solved for are said to be "active", and the
Fields have virtual functions Field::activate() and
Field::deactivate().  All four of these virtual functions operate on
the bookkeeping information stored in the Field class that lets it
extract the right DegreeOfFreedoms from the Nodes.  An active field
must be defined, but a defined field need not be active.


Out-of-plane components

Each in plane Field has out-of-plane components that we have to solve
for in order to satisfy the plane stress (or equivalent) constraints.
For example, in elastic plane stress, we solve for displacement (x and
y) but the constraint sigma_iz = 0, i=1,2,3 introduces three new
variables for the out-of-plane components of the strain.  When solving
for temperature with no out-of-plane heat flux, the out-of-plane
temperature gradient dT/dz is a new variable.

To unify the handling of these auxilliary fields, there's a
CompoundField class derived from the Field base class. The
CompoundField can return a reference to the out-of-plane part of the
field via Field &CompoundField::out_of_plane().
CompoundField::set_in_plane(bool) is used to turn the out-of-plane
part on and off.

Because of this, the Field class heirarchy gets somewhat messy. There
are plain (not compound) fields derived from Field: ScalarFieldBase,
TwoVectorFieldBase, and VectorFieldBase.  The Fields that are actually
used are derived from these and also from CompoundField:  ScalarField,
TwoVectorField, and VectorField.  The out-of-plane parts pointed to by
CompoundField are of the xxxFieldBase variety.

I used virtual inheritance so that CompoundField and xxxFieldBase
could both be derived from Field, and xxxField could be derived from
xxxFieldBase and CompoundField without including the Field base class
twice. CompoundField needs to be derived from Field, since it needs to
override the virtual functions for activating and defining the field.
xxxFieldBase needs to be derived from Field because it is a Field.
Virtual inheritance is messy but I don't see a way around it here.
One way would be to simply derive xxxField from xxxFieldBase by
including the CompoundField parts in xxxField, but then we'd have to
repeat the definition of those parts separately for *each* type of
xxxField.

Initialization

The values in the field could be set by the Mesh class (whose name
should be changed to Mesh).  The Mesh/Mesh has ways of looping over
Nodes, and it could use field(node, component)->value() = xxx.
More likely, the Fields could have various initialize functions, which
would ask the Mesh/Mesh for a NodeIterator object. So we'd have, for example,
  ScalarFieldBase::initialize(double (*f)(const Coord &position))
  TwoVectorFieldBase::initialize(Coord (*f)(const Coord &position))
to initialize from a function. These non-virtual functions could then
use the Helper classes as appropriate.
