  Python/C++ Exception Handling in OOF2

  We have achieved the basic goal of being able to generate 
arbitrary Python exceptions from either Python or underlying 
C++ code.  The scheme involves some "glue" made up of auxiliary 
functions in the interface layer, including a Python function 
that is called back from C++.  This scheme is, overall, not
more complex than other aspects of the OOF software.

  Description: 

  At the basic, topmost level of the OOF code, all exceptions must be
Python exceptions, in order to be caught and handled by the highest
level exception machinery.  Because exceptions do not always arise in
the Python layer, it is necessary to be able to map C++ exceptions to
Python exceptions using the SWIG machinery.  It is reasonably
straightforward to map arbitrary C++ exceptions into instances of the
Python "RuntimeError" exception class, with informative arguments, but
in order to utilize the full generality of Python's exception
handling, in which arbitrary Python objects can be thrown and caught,
it is preferable to map arbitrary C++ exceptions into a larger space
of Python exception objects.

  The core of the scheme which does this is made up of two components,
one of which is a modified version of the SWIG/Python "except"
typemap, and the second of which is a Python callback function. These
two aspects take care of the two tasks -- the "except" callback is
responsible for catching the C++ exception, and the Python callback is
responsible for raising a Python exception corresponding to the C++
exception which has been caught.

  The actual code (as present in the SWIG file) looks like this:

%except(python) {
  try {
    $function
  }
  catch (ErrError &e) {
    PyObject *args = Py_BuildValue("(s)", e.pythonequiv().c_str() );
    PyEval_CallObject((PyObject *)e.pyconverter, args);
    Py_DECREF(args);
    return 0;
  }
}

  Note that, unlike the usual %except wrappers as presented in the
SWIG documentation, the code in this wrapper does not explicity
raise the exception itself, i.e. it does not call PyErr_SetString or
PyErr_SetObject.  Instead, the exception is actually raised by the
callback, which is the PyEval_CallObject line.

  The class ErrError is an abstract class which is the parent class of
all catchable C++ exceptions in the application.  Every actual derived
class is required to have a member function pythonequiv(), which
returns a string which, when evaluated by Python, constructs an
instance of the Python exception corresponding to this C++ exception.
(The c_str() method belongs to the C++ std::string class, and extracts
a null-terminated char* array suitable for passing on to interface
code that doesn't understand STL containers.)  This is then passed as
an argument to the callback, which is a simple Python function which
looks like this:


def PyErrorCallback(str):
    exec("raise " + str)


  The beauty of this technique is that, as a callback from C++, this
Python function doesn't actually suspend execution and abort to the
handler, although this behavior would not be unreasonable.  Instead,
it apparently just sets the Python exception state, and then returns
to the calling statement in the SWIG'd exception wrapper.  This
wrapper does not modify the exception state, but by returning NULL (0)
to the Python environment, causes the Python exception specified in
the callback to actually be raised.  After the "catch" statement
exits, execution resumes in the appropriate enclosing Python "except"
block.

  This is all that is really required for this technique to work, but
there are a few other things that can be done to enhance the coherency
and maintainability.  Firstly, the Python callback function needs to
be accessible from C++, so we have made it a static member (of type
void*) of the abstract ErrError class, with the name "pyconverter".
In order to maintain the correspondence between the Python and C++
exception classes, it is useful to simply make the Python exceptions
SWIG'd versions of the C++ exceptions.  By this means, the same
exception structure is uniformly available to all layers of the entire
application.
 
  For all of this to work, it's necessary that the callback pointer be
assigned at start-up.  This can't be part of the static initialization
process at load-time, because that process doesn't involve Python, so
there needs to be Python code in the SWIG'd module, run at module
load-time, which assigns the pointer, presumably through a separate,
SWIG'd interface.  This would be cleaner if it could be made to happen
automatically, but the overhead tasks are quite lightweight, and they
buy you the advantage of uniformity of exception classes
application-wide.

  All of this code is in the ooferror.C, ooferror.h, ooferror.swg,
and ooferror_.py files.
