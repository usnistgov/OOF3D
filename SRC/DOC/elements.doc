Notes on the Element and MasterElement classes, and how Elements are
constructed by the GhostMesh, with a discussion of Nodes, ProtoNodes,
and divers Iterators.

Dedicated to all those Programmers who have revisited code months
after writing it, and have no clue.



The MasterElement class in OOF contains all the detail about the
element geometry, as defined in master coordinate space.  There is a
derived MasterElement class for each type of element, and a single
static instance of each class.

The Element class represents the actual elements in the mesh.  Each
Element contains a reference to a MasterElement, which determines what
kind of element it is.  There are no classes derived from Element --
all operations specific to the type of element are done by the
MasterElement.  The Element simply provides a mapping from master
space to real physical space.

The constructor for a concrete MasterElement class must create
"ProtoNodes" for each node in the element.  ProtoNodes are just like
Nodes, but they're defined in master space, and have no Field values
associated with them.  Each ProtoNode must be added to the Element
with MasterElement::addProtoNode, and its properties set by
ProtoNode::set_mapping, etc.  ProtoNodes *must* be created in the
correct order: start at a corner and go counterclockwise around the
element.  Do the interior nodes (if any) last.

An Element contains a list of Nodes, which correspond to the
ProtoNodes in the associated MasterElement.  Access to most of the
functions of an Element is done via the ElementNodeIterator classes.
There are four kinds of ElementNodeIterators:
  ElementNodeIterator  -- loops over all nodes
  ElementMapNodeIterator -- loops over mapping nodes (which determine
                            real space geometry)
  ElementFuncNodeIterator -- loops over function nodes (where fields
                             are evaluated)
  ElementCornerNodeIterator -- loops over corners nodes
The ElementNodeIterators give access to the ShapeFunctions, the Nodes,
and the ProtoNodes, and thus are ultimately responsible for the
association between ShapeFunctions, Nodes, and ProtoNodes.

Elements are created when a real Mesh is constructed from a
GhostMesh.  A GhostMesh determines the geometry of the Mesh, but
only specifies the corners of the elements, not their order or
intermediate Nodes.  The process of creating a real Element goes like
this:

The single instances of all the MasterElements are stored in a Python
dictionary, which is returned by getMasterElementList.[1]  The
dictionary keys are the names of the types of MasterElements.  These
names were assigned by the constructor of the derived MasterElement
class.  Example: "Isoparametric 3-node triangle" from tri3.C.

A call to ghost_mesh.mesh() is made using keyword arguments for the
element types.  The keywords are "triangle" and "quad".  The values
assigned to the arguments should be entries from the master element
dictionary, specifying which type of master element should be used to
construct triangular and quadrilateral elements. The kewyord arguments
are passed as a Python dictionary to ghost_element.realelement(),
which retrieves the master element type from the dictionary, using its
own 'typestring' parameter as the lookup key.

Once the ghost_element knows the master element corresponding to the
real element being created, it creates real nodes by looping over the
protonodes, determining their positions via the ghost element's shape
functions. (For this purpose, ghost elements are linear.)  The list of
real nodes is passed to the masterelement's build() function, which
constructs the actual Element.  build() is defined in
masterelement.swg, and is just a wrapper for the Element constructor,
passing in a pointer to the appropriate MasterElement and a list of
Nodes[2].


Notes:

[1]  Actually, the MasterElements are stored in a C++ vector, which is
accessed by the function masterElementList().  The vector is converted
to a dictionary by getMasterElementList().

[2] The order in which ProtoNodes are defined in the derived
MasterElement class constructor is important because it determines the
order in which Nodes are passed to the Element constructor.  The
association between Nodes and ShapeFunctions will be incorrect if the
nodes aren't presented in the right order.
