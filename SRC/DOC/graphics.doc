OOF2 GRAPHICS CODE
------------------

----------------------
=== BRIEF OVERVIEW ===
----------------------

OOF2 graphics output is defined in very general terms, in an attempt
to be device and physics independent.  Here are the basic classes:


OutputDevice:
  
  An OutputDevice is an object that actually creates output.  It
  supports a generic set of primitive output operations, which
  provides device independence.  Examples of OutputDevices are the
  CanvasOutput for screen output to a GtkCanvas, and PSoutput for
  creating postscript files.

OOFCanvas:

  OOFCanvas is the C++ class that wraps the GtkCanvas, which is the
  widget that actually draws things on the screen.  OOFCanvas is not
  quite an OutputDevice, mainly because it's a C++ class and so can't
  be derived from the Python OutputDevice class.  (That's not a real
  objection, since it doesn't have to be derived from it; it just has
  to behave like it.)  Instead, the CanvasOutput class is derived from
  OutputDevice and wraps an OOFCanvas.

GfxWindow:

  The GfxWindow is the logical wrapper for the GtkWindow that contains
  a CanvasOutput device.  It has a bunch of other things too that will
  be described below.  The GfxWindow class is derived from GhostGfxWindow.

GhostGfxWindow:

  Because OOF2 doesn't assume that the graphics module is loaded, the
  GfxWindow API is implemented in a base class that has *no*
  OutputDevice.  The GhostGfxWindow takes care of logging commands and
  maintaining state information, but doesn't actually do any output.


Display:

  A Display is a collection of DisplayLayers.  The layers are drawn in
  order, so that later (higher) layers hide earlier (lower) layers.

DisplayLayer:

  A DisplayLayer is the highest level graphics object.  Layers can be
  raised and lowered, hidden and shown.  They are created by the
  LayerEditor.  DisplayLayers are defined by four components, Who,
  What, Where, and How, which determine what the layer represents and
  how it's portrayed.  There are two kinds of DisplayLayers: regular
  layers, which are created by the LayerEditor, and overlayers, which
  are created automatically.  Overlayers always appear on top of
  regular layers.  There are also DefaultLayers, which are regular
  layers displayed on new graphics windows when no other layers are
  defined.

DisplayLayer Components:

  Who:

     The object being displayed.  Whos are instances of WhoClasses.
     The WhoClasses are Image, Microstructure, GhostMesh, and Mesh.
     See the section on WhoClasses below.

  What: 

    The specific part of Who that's being displayed.  What is
    irrelevant for some WhoClasses.  For Meshes, What is typically a
    component of a Field or Flux, or a function of Fields and Fluxes.

  Where:

     Where the data is being displayed.  Like What, Where is only
     relevant for some WhoClasses (just Mesh, at the moment).  Where
     is usually a function of position on the mesh.  Typical values
     are 'original' (position on the undistorted mesh), 'actual'
     (position on the distorted mesh), or 'enhanced' (drawn on a mesh
     with arbitrarily enhanced displacements).

  How:

     How the data is being displayed.  Different types of How are
     appropriate for different Whos and Whats.  Hows include:
    
     Bitmap:  for displaying Images and Microstructures
     ElementEdge: for displaying Meshes and GhostMeshes
     Material Color: for Meshes and GhostMeshes
     Perimeter: for Meshes and GhostMeshes
     SolidFill: for scalar functions on Meshes
     ContourLine and FilledContour: for scalar functions on Meshes

  The canonical order for DisplayLayer components, used in all cases
  in which the four components are listed together, is who, what,
  where, how.  For more about DisplayLayers, see the section on the
  LayerEditor.

Output:

  The Where and What DisplayLayer Components are instances of Outputs.
  Outputs are objects that take a set of Inputs, a set of Parameters,
  and produce a set of output values when they are applied to a Mesh.
  For example, there are Outputs that give the values of Field
  components on the Mesh.  They have two Parameters (the Field in
  question and the desired component) and no Inputs.  Outputs can be
  chained together, so that the output of one Output can be used as
  the Input for another.  Eventually, OOF2 will have an OutputEditor
  to allow users to create Output chains themselves.  For now, chains
  are predefined in engine/IO/outputClones.py (abstract outputs with
  unset Inputs and/or Parameters) and engine/IO/outputDefs.py
  (concrete Outputs with all Inputs set, so that they can actually be
  used).

DisplayMethod:

  The How part of a DisplayLayer is an instance of a DisplayMethod
  subclass.

Toolbox and ToolboxGUI:

  Toolboxes are the GUI for various kinds of operations that the user
  performs on the graphics window.  They correspond to notebook pages
  on the left side of the window.  Of course, like everything else,
  they need GUI and non-GUI pieces, so that they can work in both GUI
  and text modes.  Different parts of OOF can define their own
  toolboxes by defining Toolbox and ToolboxGUI subclasses.

GfxExtension:

  Different parts of OOF can add functions to the GhostGfxWindows and
  GfxWindows by defining subclasses of GfxExtension.  Currently this
  is used only for things that can't be done in Toolboxes.

MouseHandler:

  A MouseHandler is an object that tells the graphics window what to
  do with mouse clicks and mouse motion.  When toolboxes are activated
  they install their own MouseHandler in the graphics window.




---------------------------
=== IN DEPTH DISCUSSION ===
---------------------------

The graphics code is somewhat complicated because OOF scripts that
include graphics commands must do something sensible when the graphics
module is not loaded, and the graphics module can make no assumptions
about what other modules are loaded.  This means that there must be
mechanisms for other modules to add functionality (eg. settings or
toolboxes) to the graphics windows at load time.

A graphics window is opened by the gfxManager, whose job it is to keep
track of the open graphics windows.  There is only one gfxManager,
defined in common/IO/gfxmanager.py.  When asked to open a window, the
gfxManager opens either a GhostGfxWindow (in text mode) or a GfxWindow
(in GUI mode).  It also assigns a name to the window.

The GfxWindow class is derived from the GhostGfxWindow class, but when
opening a GfxWindow, the GhostGfxWindow constructor isn't called
immediately.  This is because many of the virtual functions redefined
in GfxWindow are called by the GhostGfxWindow constructor and rely on
data structures that must be initialized before the functions are
called.

Graphics State Variables:

The state of the graphics window is maintained by the GhostGfxWindow
part of the object.  It includes:

  The name of the window (self.name).

  A single Display object (self.display).

  A single OutputDevice object (self.device).  This is the default
  device.  It's set by the GfxWindow to be a CanvasOutput, and by the
  GhostGfxWindow to be a NullDevice.  When a window prints its
  contents, it creates a temporary PostScript device (class PSoutput).

  Settings.  Settings are variables that hold user preferences.
  Settings that are made in one window become the default value for
  all future windows.  To enforce this, each GhostGfxWindow has a
  GfxSettings object, which stores all the settings.  The GfxSettings
  class keeps track of the last value assigned to each setting, and
  uses it to initialize the next GfxSettings object.  The settings
  are:
    bgcolor: background color
    zoomfactor: magnification change when zooming in and out
    margin: amount of margin to leave when zooming to full size,
            expressed as a fraction of the full size
    antialias: boolean controlling antialiasing on the canvas
  Modules can add their own settings to the graphics windows by
  calling ghostgfxwindow.defineGfxSetting(name, defaultvalue) at load time.
  For example, the Image module adds 'showSelectedPixels'.
 
  A boolean value, 'hold', which inhibits redrawing the window when true.
 
  A reference to the currently selected DisplayLayer.

  The currently active ToolBox.

  The menus which control the graphics window.


Graphics Window Initialization
------------------------------

The graphics window initialization process is as follows:

- The gfxManager calls GfxWindow.__init__()  (in GUI mode).
- The GfxWindow gets its settings by creating a GfxSettings object.
- The window creates all of its GTK+ infrastructure and assigns callbacks.
- The window creates a dictionary of toolboxes and stores a dummy 
  toolbox called None.
- The window creates a canvas by calling newCanvas().  This uses some of
  the settings, which is why the settings had to be constructed first.
  It creates a OOFCanvas (self.oofcanvas) and a CanvasOutput (self.device).
- The GhostGfxWindow constructor is called, which...
+ Constructs a Display object.
+ Initializes its device to NullDevice, unless the GfxWindow has
  already initialized it.
+ Initializes its toolbox and mouseHandler to dummy objects.
+ Creates menus, including some (like 'Settings/Show_Selected') that
  are empty and will be filled in by toolboxes and extensions.
+ Instantiates all GfxExtensionClasses and stores a list of them.  See
  'Extensions' below.
+ Creates Toolboxes.  See 'Toolboxes' below.
+ Creates default DisplayLayers.  See 'Default Layers' below.
+ Creates overlayers.  See 'Overlayers' below.
+ Sensitizes the menus (layer operations are active iff a layer is
  selected, etc.)
- Then the GfxWindow constructor resumes, and assigns gui callbacks to
  menu items, creates the gui menus, and finally draws the default
  DisplayLayers.

GfxExtension
------------

Features can be added to the graphics windows by subclassing
GfxExtension and registering the subclass by calling
ghostgfxwindow.registerGfxExtensionClass(name, subclass).  A
GfxExtension provides a number of functions (hooks) which are called
by the GhostGfxWindow at appropriate times.  The hooks all have
trivial implementations in the bas GfxExtension class, so subclasses
can ignore ones that they don't need.  The hooks are:

__init__(self, gfxwindow)

  The GhostGfxWindow constructor will create instances of the
  subclass, calling the subclass constructor with the graphics window
  as an argument.  The derived class's __init__() must call the base
  class __init__().

close(self):

  Called when the graphics window is closed.  Must call the base class
  close() method.

createOverLayers(self):

  Called during construction.  Must return a list of OverLayer
  objects (see below).  Does not have to call the base class method.

Because GfxExtension objects are not created until the graphics window
is created, an extension that needs to behave differently in GUI mode
can be redefined when the GUI code is loaded.  For example, the Image
extension, ImageExtension, is defined in image/IO/gfxextension.py.
One of the things it does is to add a few items to the graphics window
menu in its makeMenus() routine. The GUI part of the extension is
defined in image/IO/GUI/gfxextensionGUI.py, and it redefines
ImageExtension.makeMenus(), adding GUI callbacks to the menu items.


Toolbox and GfxToolbox
----------------------

Like GfxExtensions, Toolboxes are a way of extending the graphics
window.   Each toolbox contains a set of related operations that act
on the display.  For example, the PixelSelectToolbox interprets mouse
clicks on an image and generates sets of pixels.  Only one toolbox is
active at a time.  In GUI mode, the toolboxes correspond to
GtkNotebook pages on the left side of the graphics window.

Unlike GfxExtensions, Toolboxes are expected to have a concrete
presence in the GUI as well as a non-gui API that can be used in text
mode.  Therefore they are based on two classes, Toolbox (in
common/toolbox.py) and GfxToolbox (in common/IO/GUI/toolboxGUI.py).
Each new Toolbox subclass must be registered by calling
   toolbox.registerToolboxClass(subclass, ordering).
The subclass must override the function Toolbox.makeGUI(), which
must return an object derived from GfxToolbox.

The derived GfxToolbox can also be derived from MouseHandler, via
multiple inheritance, or it can contain a MouseHandler object.  It
should not actually do much itself, other than to make non-GUI menu
calls through its non-GUI counterpart.  The arguments to those calls
can include coordinates returned by the MouseHandler functions.

Toolbox Details:

registerToolboxClass(subclass, ordering)

  subclass is a subclass of Toolbox.  ordering is a number used to
  sort the toolboxes in the GUI and other listings (if any).

The following functions in the Toolbox base class can be redefined in
the derived classes.  All redefinitions are optional, except for
__init__.

DerivedToolbox.__init__(self, gfxwindow)
Toolbox.__init__(self, name, gfxwindow)

  This function *must* be redefined in the derived class.  The derived
  class function must call the base class function.  The derived class
  function is called during GhostGfxWindow construction, passing in a
  reference to the window.  The derived class must pass a name along
  to the base class constructor.

Toolbox.makeGUI(self)

  This function is called only in graphics mode, and must return an
  instance of the corresponding GfxToolbox subclass.  See below for
  more on GfxToolbox.  The makeGUI definition should be added to the
  Toolbox subclass in graphics mode only.

Toolbox.makeMenu(self, menu)

  Called during graphics window construction after the base menus have
  been built.  The OOFMenuItem passed in as an argument is where all
  of the toolbox's commands should be placed.  The menu name is the
  name of the toolbox, as passed to Toolbox.__init__.  All toolbox
  actions should have corresponding menu items.  The gui part of the
  toolbox should invoke the menu items, whose non-gui callbacks
  actually perform the actions.

Toolbox.activate(self)
Toolbox.deactivate(self)

  Called when this toolbox becomes active or inactive.

Toolbox.close(self)

  Called when the graphics window is closing.

The following functions in GfxToolbox may be overridden in the derived
class:

GfxToolbox.__init__(self, toolbox)

  The derived class __init__ must call the base class __init__.  Both
  take the same argument, which is a reference to the corresponding
  non-GUI toolbox.  This is stored in the GUI base class as
  self.toolbox.  Thus, GfxToolbox instances refer to their enclosing
  GfxWindows via self.toolbox.gfxwindow.  The base class also creates
  a GtkFrame, self.gtk, into which all of the derived class's gui
  objects must be placed.

GfxToolbox.activate(self)
GfxToolbox.deactivate(self)

  Called when the toolbox is activated or deactivated.  When switching
  toolboxes, the old gui toolbox is deactivated, then the old non-gui
  toolbox is deactivated, then the new non-gui toolbox is activated,
  and finally the new gui toolbox is activated.  The gui activation
  and deactivation functions are good places in which to set the
  graphics window's mouseHandler.

GfxToolbox.close(self)

  Called when the graphics window is closed.


MouseHandler
------------

The behavior of the mouse in a graphics window is determined by the
window's current MouseHandler, stored in GfxWindow.mouseHandler.  When
a GfxToolbox is activated (ie, when GfxToolbox.activate() is called),
it should install its own MouseHandler in the graphics window by
calling self.toolbox.gfxwindow.setMouseHandler(handler).  Here handler
is an instance of a MouseHandler subclass (which may be self, if the
GfxToolbox instance is also a MouseHandler instance).  When the
toolbox is deactivated, its handler is automatically uninstalled,
although the handler can be removed earlier by calling
GfxWindow.removeMouseHandler().

MouseHandler derived classes may override the following four functions.
All of the functions have trivial no-op base class definitions, so
derived classes can ignore irrelevant functions.

MouseHandler.acceptEvent(self, eventtype)

  Returns 1 if the handler is interested in receiving an event of type
  eventtype, and 0 otherwise.  The possible event types are the
  strings 'up', 'down', and 'move'.  When the GfxWindow receives a
  mouse event, it calls acceptEvent, and if acceptEvent returns 1 the
  window calls one of the following three functions:

MouseHandler.up(self, x, y)
MouseHandler.down(self, x, y)
MouseHandler.move(self, x, y)

  The coordinates passed to up, down, and move are in the physical
  coordinate system, so they're floats and independent of the screen
  resolution.  Note that 'move' events are sent whenever the mouse is
  over the window, even if the button is not pressed.  They are also
  sent when the mouse is *not* over the window if the button was first
  pressed in the window and has not yet been released.


Default Layers
--------------

When a graphics window is opened with the OOF.Graphics.New_Window
command, it opens with a set of default DisplayLayers.  What exactly
is shown, of course, depends on which oof modules are loaded and what
data is present.  The DefaultLayer class in
common/IO/ghostgfxwindow.py allows modules to define the layers that
will appear in new windows.

To define a default layer, a module creates a DefaultLayer object.
All DefaultLayer instances are automatically stored in a list in the
DefaultLayer class, so the instantiating module doesn't need to keep a
reference to the layer.  The arguments to the constructor are a
function and an ordering.  The function will be called when the layer
is actually constructed, and must return a tuple (who, what, where,
how) of the layer components.  If they layer cannot be defined the
function must return None.  The list of DefaultLayers are sorted by
the layers' ordering parameter, and drawn in sequence.  Layers with
high orderings appear above layers with low ones.


OverLayer
_________

Overlayers are layers that aren't editable by the LayerEditor, but are
always present.  They also are always on top of the user defined and
default layers, which is why they're called OverLayers.  OverLayers
are created by GfxExtensions when their createOverLayers function is
called.  createOverLayers() returns a list of OverLayer objects.  The
OverLayer constructor takes five arguments: the four layer components,
who, what, where, and how, and an ordering.  The ordering is used just
like the ordering for Default Layers.


Who and WhoClass
----------------

The WhoClass class defines types of objects that can be displayed.
Each WhoClass instance contains a list of Whos, which wrap the actual
displayable objects.  (The reason for this extra wrapper is that it
puts C++ and Python objects on the same footing.)  Each WhoClass
instance has a name and an ordering, which determines where it appears
in the LayerEditor's Who selection widget.

The WhoClass constructor takes the following arguments:
    name
    ordering
    instanceClass (optional, defaults to Who)
    secret        (optional, defaults to 0)

The instanceClass, if provided, must be a subclass of Who.  New
members of the WhoClass (new Whos) should never be created directly;
instead they're created by calling WhoClass.add(self, name, object)
which wraps the object in the instanceClass and adds it to the list in
the WhoClass.

The 'secret' argument to the WhoClass constructor should be 1 if the
class is not to be made visible in the LayerEditor.  This allows
classes meant to be used only for OverLayers to use the same display
machinery.

The class Who wraps the actual displayable objects.  It gives them a
name, by which they are referred to in the UI, and handles some
internal bookkeeping.   For example, Who.getClass() allows the GUI to
determine the WhoClass of a given Who. 

If necessary, subclasses can be derived from Who.  In this case, the
subclass must be passed to the WhoClass constructor.  The subclass
constructor *must* take exactly the same arguments as the Who
constructor, namely:
  name		a string
  classname	another string, for identification in the GUI. 
  obj		the object being wrapped
  index		an integer
All of the arguments are created by WhoClass.add(), and must be passed
through to Who.__init__ from the subclass's __init__.

Useful functions:

WhoClass.add(self, name, object)

  Creates and stores a Who object.

WhoClass.remove(self, name)

  Removes the Who object of the given name.

WhoClass.__len__(self)

  Returns the number of Who objects in the WhoClass.

WhoClass.__getitem__(self, index)

Who.requestCallback(self, *args)

  args are passed through to switchboard.requestCallback().  The only
  point of this function is that the switchboard callback is removed
  when the Who object is removed from the WhoClass.


The function GhostGfxWindow.topmost(self, whoclass) returns the Who
object in the topmost DisplayLayer with a Who of the given class.


Output
------

The Output class provides a way of defining arbitrary functions that
can be evaluated on the Mesh and plotted.  Outputs receive input,
apply a function to it, and produce output.  The input can come from
another Output instance, so Outputs can be chained together.  Outputs
can have any number of inputs, so the plumbing can get complicated,
but this allows for quite general functions to be defined in terms of
simple operations.

Every Output has an oType attribute, which specifies the type of
values it produces.  oType can be a Python type or an instance of a
class or a list or tuple thereof.  It's stored internally as a
TypeChecker instance (from common/IO/parameter.py).  For example, the
FieldOutput's oType is types.ListType, because it produces a list
corresponding to the components of a Field.

Outputs also have parameters, which are stored as named Parameter
instances (also from common/IO/parameter.py).  For example, the
generic FieldOutput has a single parameter, called "field", which
indicates which Field is to be put out.

An Output's inputs are also named.  In fact, the Input class is
derived from Parameter.  When one Output is used as another Output's
input, the oType of the first Output must satisfy the TypeChecker of
the second Output's Input.  For example, the Component Output expects
a FieldOutput as its input, so 

Output is not meant to be used as a base class.  Instead, it supports
a kind of dynamic pseudo-subclassing.  Outputs can be defined in terms
of other Outputs, and defined Outputs can be registered by name,
making them available for future use. ....

Outputs have the following attributes:

  name:  by which they're known in the UI
  help:  a descriptive string
  oType:  the type of value they produce



The LayerEditor
