Coord:
  A point in 2-space.
  Implemented as an instance of the template class BaseCoord, so that
  Coord and MasterCoord can be distinct types.

---

IndexType:
  A template class used for indexing arrays, etc. An IndexType acts
  just like an integer. Different IndexTypes are distinct types, so
  the compiler will prevent you from using the wrong one.

  NodeIndex is used to enumerate the nodes in an element.
  SpaceIndex is used to enumerate dimensions.

---

Field:
     name          used for I/O
     active/inactive
     defined/undefined
     index
     dimension  (how many numbers are required to specify field at a point)

  The field class doesn't contain the actual field values, it's just
  used to manage the degrees of freedom (eg as an index into the lists
  of degrees of freedom at each node.)
     
  One instance of this class exists for each field. Ie, field.h will
  contain
      extern Field temperature;
      extern Field displacement; 

  Subclasses for different kinds of fields:
  ScalarField, VectorField<dimension>, TensorField<dimension>, etc.

  Fields are defined if they have values stored at nodes. They are
  active if their values will be solved for.

  The value of a field at a node is obtained by field(node) [for
  scalar fields] or field(node, i) [for vector fields].

----

DegreeOfFreedom:
     value
     fixed or free?

  Subclasses for different kinds of fields, ScalarDegreeOfFreedom,
  etc.  Possibly the subclasses could be templated:
  DegreeOfFreedom<ScalarField>.  See note 2
  
I no longer think we need to keep original values and displacements
for all degrees of freedom.


----

Node:
    list of (pointers to?) Degrees Of Freedom.  See note 2
    index
    Coord original_position;
    Coord position(); // original position + displacement
 
----

Element:
    pointer to Material.
    pointer to ShapeFunction.
    ElementNodeIterators that are used for accessing nodes. See below.
    number of shape functions used for mapping
    number of shape functions used for function interpolation
    function that returns a GaussPoint for integration.
    nonvirtual functions for computing stiffness matrix, right hand side.
    mapping functions for converting from physical coordinates to
       element coordinates.
    virtual function that returns a pointer to a MasterElement.

  Subclasses for different shapes and orders. (linear triangle, 8
  point quad, etc).

  When asked for its contribution to the stiffness matrix or rhs, the
  element just asks its Material to do the real work, eg:
   Element::make_stiffness(...) { material->make_stiffness(this, ...); }

  ShapeFunction is a separate class so that different interpolation
  methods can be used.

  Elements may be isoparametric, subparametric, or superparametric,
  although these need not be formal subclasses. Isoparametric elements
  use the same set of shapefunctions for mapping the element geometry
  as they do for interpolating the fields.  Subparametric elements use
  fewer shapefunctions for the geometry, and superparametric elements
  use more.
  
  Iterators for iterating over map nodes & interpolation nodes...
    virtual ElementNodeIterator *parnode_iterator();
    virtual ElementNodeIterator *mapnode_iterator();
  Returned by virtual functions.  Providing access to nodes in this
  way allows the interface to be the same for sub-, super-, and
  isoparametric elements.  The connection between a Node and a
  shapefunction is made ONLY via the ElementNodeIterator:
     ElementNodeIterator n;
     n.node() is a pointer to a node.
     n.sf_index() is the index of a shape function.  This shape
         function is non-zero at node n.node().
  For convenience, all Element routines (shapefun, dshapefun) which
  need to know the correspondence between node and shapefunction
  actually take the ElementNodeIterator as a argument:

     for(ElementNodeIterator n=element->node_iterator(); !n.end(); ++n) {
        Node *node = n.node();
	ShapeFunctionIndex ni = n.sf_index();
     }

----

MasterElement:

   Keeps track of all the stuff that's shared between all elements of
   a given type, mainly the lists of gauss points.  There is just one
   instance of each kind of MasterElement.

----

Material:
    list of pointers to Properties
    registry of particular properties
    nonvirtual functions for computing stiffness matrix, right hand side

  The Material is just a collection of properties.

  The Material computes the stiffness matrix and rhs by asking each
  Property to do the real work:
   Material::stiffnessmatrix(Element* el) { 
      loop over Properties
         property[i]->stiffnessmatrix(el, this);

  The "particular properties" are ones that might need to be
  referenced by other properties. Eg, the thermal expansion property
  will need to know the elasticity, so that it can ask for Cijkl.  So
  when an Elasticity property is added to the list in the Material, it
  registers itself as an "Elasticity" property.  The thermal expansion
  property will look in the registry to find the "Elasticity" property,
  and will store a pointer to it.  This will all happen when the material
  is constructed, so there will be no overhead during the actual calculation.

----

Property:
  Each additive term in the equations of motion (or energy
  functional) is a separate Property.

  Subclasses for Elasticity, ThermalExpansion, ThermalConductivity,
  etc.  Elasticity will have further subclasses Isotropic, Hexagonal,
  etc.

  Properties add their own contributions to the stiffness matrix and
  rhs with Property::make_stiffness(Element*, Material*).  They use the
  Element pointer to get shape functions and Integrators.

  Certain kinds of properties may make no contribution to the
  stiffness matrix, but may contribute instead to the rhs through
  body_forces(Element*, Material*).

  They also may contribute to flux boundary conditions by integrating
  a given flux across a Boundary and contributing to the rhs.

  Given nodal fields, a Property can compute it's contribution to a
  specified Flux (used after equilibration, to compute forces of
  constraint). 

  When Properties are created, they can register themselves in the
  Material's registry [eg, material->registry.register(this, "Elasticity")].
  After all of a Material's Properties are created, the Properties can
  use the registry to find other Properties that they may need to
  refer to [ Property *otherproperty=material->registry.retrieve("Elasticity")].

----

Mesh:

  Lists of Elements, Nodes, DegreesOfFreedom.
  Equilibration methods.
  General control.

----

MasterCoord:

  A point in the coordinate system of the master element.
  Implemented as an instance of the template class BaseCoord, so that
  Coord and MasterCoord can be distinct types.

----

GaussPoint:  Gaussian Integration Point  -- see gausspoint.h for the
                                            way this really works.
  Coord coord -- position in real space
  MasterCoord mc --- position of point in master element's parameter space
  weight --- include jacobian factor, since gauss weight and jacobian
            are never needed separately. (is that true?)
  index --- used by shape function for fast function lookup
  
  operator++ -- go to next gauss point
  bool end() -- are we done integrating?

  
----

ShapeFunction:  see shapefunction.h

   The ShapeFunction class computes a whole set of shape functions,
   differentiated by the ShapeFunctionIndex argument.  The connection
   between shape functions and nodes is made by the
   ElementNodeIterator, which is described in the discussion of
   Element, above.

   Only to be evaluated in master element coordinates.  Keeps a table
   of values at the Element's Gauss points, since those will be the
   ones used most often.  There's one instance of each ShapeFunction
   class for each type of Element, not for each Element itself.

   operator()(i, MasterCoord):  value of function i
   operator()(i, GaussPoint):  value at precomputed Gauss point.
   double deriv(i, SpaceIndex, GaussPoint)  derivatives with respect
                                            to master coords
   The index i is a ShapeFunctionIndex.

   If the shape function also has to be evaluated in physical
   coordinates, then it will have to keep a pointer to the
   element, and we'll need a separate ShapeFunction object for each
   individual Element. So to compute shape functions in real space,
   use the Element's mapping functions to compute a master coordinate.

   The ShapeFunction class isn't actually called directly, it's called
   through the base Element's shapefun() and dshapefun() methods, so
   unless you're programming new Elements you shouldn't have to know
   anything about it.

   There are cpu-intensive quantities that depend on both the
   ShapeFunction and the Element (such as the determinant of the
   jacobian at the gauss points).  These values should be cached for
   reuse, but since an Element has two ShapeFunctions, the
   ShapeFunction must do the caching.  The cache is kept only so long
   as we're doing computation on the same Element.

-----------

Equation:  (incomplete)

Columns in the global stiffness matrix are indexed by the
DegreeOfFreedom class.  Rows are indexed by the Equation class: eg,
the heat equation *at a particular node* corresponds to one row of the
matrix.  The Node uses the Equation class to return an index into the
matrix.  Each equation that the program can solve has a single global
Equation object.  int Node::eqno(Equation, int component) returns a
matrix row number. The equation numbers at a node are allocated as
they're needed (as the Property classes build the matrix), so that the
matrix doesn't get bigger than necessary.  The Mesh keeps track of
which equation numbers are available (Mesh::neweqn, Grid::reseteqns).

---

FieldIndex:

Base class for objects which index the components of Fields and
Fluxes.  Derived classes include ScalarFieldIndex (trivial),
VectorFieldIndex, and VoigtIndex. The FieldIndex can be incremented
and can be converted to an integer.

FieldIterator:

Wrapper for FieldIndex so that Flux and Field classes can (in effect)
return a pointer to the appropriate type of FieldIndex, initialized
appropriately.  The classes have to return a pointer so that the
virtual functions in FieldIndex can be used.  The wrapper frees the
user from worrying about deallocating the pointer.

-----------

NOTES

1. The usual field is displacement, not position, but each
   DegreeOfFreedom has an initial value and a deviation, so the
   displacement is the deviation of the position.  Using position
   instead of displacement means that the Node's position doesn't have
   to be stored separately.  OBSOLETE


2.  I can think of two ways of storing the Degrees of freedom in the
    Nodes.  The DegreeOfFreedom can be a simple class, always
    representing a scalar, and more complicated fields will just take
    up more than one spot in the Node's list.  This will be more
    efficient in terms of storage, but will require more complicated
    bookkeeping. The other way is to have subclasses for different
    kinds of Degrees of Freedom, which means that the Node has to keep
    a list of pointers.

    Since sometimes the flags (fixed, free, etc) for the degrees of
    freedom will be set separately for the different components of a
    field, it makes more sense to make the DegreeOfFreedom class store
    a scalar degree of freedom, and let the field handle the
    bookkeeping.  So node[field] will return the composite (scalar,
    vector) degree of freedom, but node.dof(field, i) will return the
    DegreeOfFreedom class object for the i^th component of the field.
