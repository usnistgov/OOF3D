  The OOF2 Material Editor
  ------------------------

OOF2 provides a facility for naming and parametrizing properties, and
aggregating properties into named materials.  The resulting materials
are then intended to be associated with particular regions of a model
system, providing the finite-element computation with its physics.  This
document is a description of this facility.


  User's Guide
  ------------

There are two menus which are used in the construction of materials,
both descended directly from the application's main OOF menu.  These
are the Property menu, and the Material menu.  Properties and
materials can be constructed, loaded from files, modified, saved, and
deleted.  The menu commands are not sensitive to any notion of
selection state, but instead take arguments indicating their operands.
In the GUI version of the material editor, the GUI itself maintains a
"current property" and a "current material", and the various GUI
buttons operate on the current selection.  This is actually
accomplished by the GUI issuing ordinary menu commands, filling in
their arguments from the selection state.  Consequently, a sequence of
operations which take place on the GUI can be scripted, saved, and
re-run with the same results.


  Command reference
  -----------------

  Menu: OOF.File.Load_data(filename='foo')    
  GUI:  File -> Load data

  Parses a file in the OOF restricted environment, a special evaluation
namespace which forbids a number of potentially-harmful operations
such as access to the file system.  Properties and materials are in
fact saved as ordinary Python scripts, and can be read via "File ->
Load -> Script", but the "Load data" function provides extra protection
for data-like objects, which we hope will be widely traded even
between untrusted (in the security sense) systems.

  Objects read in from a file are automatically added to the
PropertyManager and the MaterialManager, as appropriate, and can
subsequently be manipulated via the menus.  Properties present as
arguments to a material constructor appear both in the property tree,
and in the material's property list.


  The property manager has two types of entries in a hierarchical
property list, those which are parametrizable and those which are not.
Non-parametrizable properties are entries in list which cannot be
inserted into materials.  They function as named place-holders in the
property tree, and typically occur at the heads of subtrees,
indicating the category of the subtree.  For example, "Elasticity" is
not meaningful as an actual property, but it is the head of a subtree
which contains a parametrizable property, "IsoElasticity", as well as
another nonparametrizable property, "Anisotropic".  "Anisotropic", in
turn, has parametrizable sub-objects corresponding to the various
crystallographic symmetries of elasticity.


The main list of properties is constructed at the time that the code
for the properties themselves is imported, and so will automatically
be extended as new properties are coded.  This list is available to
the user is three basic forms, one in the graphical user interface,
and the other two through the menu hierarchy.
 
(1): It appears as a "tree" in the Property frame, on the left hand
side of the Materials page of the main OOF notebook.  Properties can
be selected and deselected by clicking on them, and right-clicking on
this tree brings up a parametrization dialog for the current property.
This is how the actual values for the various physical features of an
OOF material are set.

(2): When selecting properties via a script or the command-line, the
property names provided are colon-separated lists of node names in the
tree, so that, for instance, to select a property "Child" which is
below "intermediate", which in turn is below "Parent" in the tree, the
command would be:
OOF.Property.Select(propname="Parent:Intermediate:Child").

(3): When providing parameter values from the command line, the
property tree appers as a hierarchical set of menu entries below the
"OOF.Property.Parametrize" item.  So, for instance, if "Child" in the
foregoing example had a single parameter "size", you could provide a
value of 100.0 for this parameter by means of the command:
OOF.Property.Parametrize.Parent.Intermediate.Child(size=100.0)



  Menu:  OOF.File.Save_property(propname='Parent:Child', filename='foo') 
  GUI:   File -> Save property

  Saves the named property to the file.  Properties are written in such
a way that they can be read back in via Load_data, or embedded in a
script.


  Menu:  OOF.File.Save_material(matname='material', filename='foo') 
  GUI:   File -> Save material
    
  Writes out a "newMaterial" call which constructs the current material
to the indicated file.


  Menu:  OOF.Property.Copy(oldpropname='Parent:Child', newpropname='leaf')     
  GUI:   "Copy" button at top of Property frame

  If Parent:Child is a parametrizable property, a new child property
will be created and added to the tree.  The new property will be of
the same type as the old, but can be parametrized separately.


  Menu:  OOF.Property.Delete(propname='Parent:Child')                
  GUI:   "Delete" button at bottom of Property frame.
 
  Removes the named property from the property list, and from all
materials in which it appears.


  Menu:  OOF.Property.Parametrize(params...)
  GUI:   Right-click on property tree.

  See "Property Tree" section below.  Allows parameters to be set in
properties.

  Menu: OOF.Material.New(matname='mat') 
  GUI: "New" button at bottom of Material frame.

  Creates a new material with the given name, and selects it.

 
  Menu:  OOF.Material.Copy(matname='mat',newname='mat2')
  GUI:   "Copy" button at bottom of the Material frame.

  Makes a copy of the current material using the new name.  The new material has all of the same properties as the old one.


  Menu:  OOF.Material.Add_property(matname='mat', propname='Parent:Child') 
  GUI:   "Load Property" button at bottom of *Property* frame.

  Loads the named property into the named material.
  

  Menu:  OOF.Material.Remove_property(matname='mat', propname='Parent:Child'))
  GUI:   "Remove Property" button at bottom of Material frame

  Removes the named property from the named material.

  
  Menu:  OOF.Material.Delete(matname='mat')
  GUI:   "Delete" button at bottom of Material frame.

  Removes the current material from the application.  Does not remove
the material's properties from the main property list.


  

  Anatomy:
  -------  

  The two main componenets of the materials editor are the
PropertyManager and the MaterialManager.  These objects are singletons
(although this is not enforced), and contain all of the property and
material data known to the OOF system.  User operations originating in
the GUI are typically serviced by calls to menu objects, so that the
commands get logged, and so that graphical and command-line
functionality are guaranteed to be consistent.

  In addition to these two main objects, there are a number of
additional support objects.  The PropertyManager's principal data
object is a LabelTree, which contains either PropertyRegistration
objects, or NamedPropertyRegistration objects hierarchically within
it.  The GUI representation of the property tree is handled within the
LabelTree class system, which has a GUI component.  The two
Registration-type classes supplant the functionality of the
"Registration" class for properties, because properties have special
requirements at instantiation time.  On the Material side, data
entries in the MaterialManager are MaterialProps objects, which
themselves contain a Python dictionary of PropertyRegistration or
NamedPropertyRegistration references indexed by name.

  The GUI representation of Materials is slightly more complex.  The two
principal widgets are the GtkOption menu indicating which material
name is current, and a GtkList showing the current material's
properties.  The GUI GtkList is a singleton, and contains all the
properties for all the materials, but selectively hides and shows
different sets depending on the selection state of the GtkOption menu.
In order to do the bookkeeping, the GtkListItem objects in the list
are wrapped in MaterialPropGUI objects, and these objects are in turn
aggregated into several MaterialListGUI objects, on for each material.
The MaterialListGUI object hides or shows its MaterialPropGUI objects
in response to changes in the GtkOption menu's selection state.
  


  Signalling Summary
  ------------------

  The only nontrivial task for signalling in the materialeditor in the
synchronization of the selection state between the property and
material components of the GUI.  Other functions are implemented by
button callbacks which query the GUI selection state in order to
provide arguments to menu commands, which they then run to implement
the appropriate function.

  GUI selection events originate with mouse clicks in either the
property or materials portions of the editor, and selection of a given
property in one pane implies its selection in the other.  Also, when a
new material is selected, if it contains a property corresponding to
the current selection of the Property pane, that property should also
become selected in the Materials pane.

  In the PropertyPane, the selection and deselection process is divided
into two parts.  The first part, the direct callback for the GUI
selection event, makes two calls, one to local selection routine, and
the other to the MaterialPane object's selection routine, each call
being made with the name of the selected property.  The called
routines are the "real" selection routines, and manipulate the GUI
directly, blocking the selection or deselection callback and calling
the appropriate GUI object's "select" (or "deselect") method.

  The MaterialsPane has a similar structure, but with an extra level.
Corresponding to each material, there is a MaterialListGUI object,
which contains the GUI counterparts of the properties, and it is
within this object that the gtk signals are caught.  From the gtk
callback in the MateralListGUI called "GUI_select_prop", control flows
up to the MaterialsPane object's prop_select routine, which then calls
both the materialsPane and propertyPane's "select_property" routines.
Within the materialsPane's "select_property", control is passed to the
current MaterialListGUI object's "select_prop" routine, which then
blocks the callback and manipulates the GUI.
  
  The actual selection state is stored as an instance attribute in the
object iself.  In the PropertyPane, this is "self.current_property",
and it's either None or a (name, registration) tuple.  In the
MaterialPane, the corresopnding object is "self.current_material",
which is either None or a MaterialListGUI object.  MaterialListGUI
objects in turn have a "self.current_element" attribute, which is
either None or the *name* of the selected property.  Names, in this
context, are fully qualified names which refer to the PropertyTree,
that is, a colon-separated set of property identifiers.

  In the PropertyPane, the direct callbacks are "on_tree_select" and
"on_tree_deslect", and the indirect routines are "select_property" and
"deselect_property".  In the MaterialsPane, the "prop_select" and
"prop_deselect" routines are called via the GUI, but not directly --
the call is mediated by the MaterialListGUI object, which contains the
gtk objects corresponding to property entries in materials.  These
"prop_select" and "prop_deselect" routines call both the MaterialPane
and PropertyPane "select_property" and "deselect_property" routines,
respectively.

  Within the MaterialsPane, there is additional code for the selection
and deselection of materials, the core of which is the
"selection_sync" routine of the MaterialListGUI object.  This routine
extracts the current property from the PropertyPane, searches itself
for the corresponding entry, and, if found, selects the corresponding
GTK object by calling its own "select_prop" routine, which operates on
the actual GTK objects.

     
  The Property Tree
  -----------------

  The registrations for the property objects in the PropertyManager
resemble those of a conventional registered class, but with several
modifications because of the unique behavior of the Property class.

  At material importation time, property registration objects are made
available in the user namespace under the a special name, which is the
name that appears in the PropertyTree.  This name is meant to be
descriptive and understandable to users, and is not in general the
same as the class name represented by the registration object.
Because the registration's __call__ method creates an instance of the
represented property, this name functions like the class name of the
property from the user's point of view.  The actual class name of the
property is usually closely related -- the current fashion is to have
the actual property class name be the registration object's name,
appended with "Prop".

Unlike conventional registered classes, PropertyRegistration objects
push instances of the objects they represent through to the host
materials, if any, whenever their parameters change, either through
the GUI, through the menus, or during initialization.  All property
instances in OOF2 know their corresponding PropertyRegistration
objects as data, and do not have to look it up in the registry.  The
principal purpose of the PropertyRegistration is to host the Parameter
objects, and to allow parameters to be adjusted in a flexible way
through either the GUI or menu commands.

  There are two types of PropertyRegistration objects, the parent
PropertyRegistration class, and the child NamedPropertyRegistration
class.  Instancing a property via the PropertyRegistration's __call__
method causes it to create a NamedPropertyRegistration, which it then
associates with the new instance.  NamedPropertyRegistration objects
appear in the tree as sub-entries under the PropertyRegistration
objects, labelled by their names.  NamedPropertyRegistration objects
are *not* exported into the scripting namespace.

  The tree contained within the PropertyManager can be manipulated in
essentially three ways -- through the GUI, via the menus, or directly
via command-line operations.  GUI manipulations are straightforward.
Properties can be deleted or added by means of the various buttons,
and the current property can be parametrized by right-clicking on the
tree, which brings up a parametrization dialog within which all the
values for any parameters can be set.  Menu operations are similar,
although parametrization is more subtle.  The PropertyManager's tree
object has a corresponding menu object, which is available to the OOF2
user under the "OOF.Property.Parametrize" heirarchy.  The menu item in
question takes as keyword arguments all of the parameters of the
Property, except the "name" parameter.  This also means that, in
interactive use, the user can use the OOF2 default menu functionality
with no arguments to find out what parameters the object expects.  

  The third interaction path, direct command-line operations, is unique
to the Property classes.  Invoking a PropertyRegistration's "call"
method, by using the name as though it were a function, causes a
property instance to be created, possibly including (in the case of
named properties) a new corresponding NamedPropertyRegistration
instance.  In the named case, a new entry is automatically added to
the tree, and is subsequently available for parametrization, insertion
into materials, deletion, and so forth, the same as any other
property.

  Unnamed properties are placed in the tree at import time.  They can be
deleted from the tree, but there is no GUI or command-based way of
directly creating new ones -- these entries can only be created by the
importation of a Python module containing the code for the property in
question.


  The Material List
  -----------------

  Operation of the material list is straightforward, although there are
a few opportunities for indirect surprises.  The material list
maintains consistency with the property tree, both in terms of
selection state and available properties.  This means that deleting a
property from the property tree also removes it from all materials in
which it occurs.  Material objects in the materialmanager have copies
of actual instances of all of their properties.  When the property
parameters change, they implement the updating process by removing the
old property from their material, and adding the new one.  By this
means, fully-realized materials are always available for insertion
into meshes and so forth, although of course consistency or sanity of
the materials so constructed cannot be guaranteed.
