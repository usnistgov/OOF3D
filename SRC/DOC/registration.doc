  Registered Classes in OOF2
  --------------------------

From time to time in the OOF code, it is desirable to aggregate
parameter values for a class prior to, or in general independently of,
the creation of an instance of that class.  This separation of
functionality allows the registration object to maintain some state
information, remembering the most-recently applied parameters, as well
as presenting a uniform interface to other objects within OOF2 which
communicate with the user, such as menus and GUI dialog boxes.  The
parameter aggregation mechanism which accomplishes this is the
"Registration" class.

  Python classes which wish to use this interface should inherit from
RegisteredClass.  Currently, the only registered C class is Property.
This class is specialized in a variety of ways, and inherits from
"RegisteredCClass", which itself does not reproduce the
RegisteredClass interface.  The property classes are the subject of a
another documentation file, where all of this is explained.


  How To
  ------

  Registration objects (or subclasses) aggregate data in a list of
instances of the "Parameter" class.  This class is a "smart" data
container.  Every Parameter has a name, a set of allowed types, and
possibly a default value for the data it contains.  The principal
function of the Registration object is to manage its parameter set,
setting and retrieving values.  In some cases, the Registration object
will share references to its list of Parameters, allowing other
objects to set values within them -- this is the mechanism by which it
communicates with the GUI, for example.

  Each set of registered classes lives within a class hierarchy headed
by a descendant of "RegistredClass" which has as class data (*not*
instance data) a list, called "registry".  This will contain the list
of all registration objects for that class.  Because this list is
class data, it exists prior to any instance of the class.

  Registration objects for subclasses in the set of registered classes
should be created at import-time, in the same file in which the class
is defined.  In the most basic case, this is a simple matter of a
direct call to the "Registration" class object.  The required
arguments are: The name of the class, the class containing the
registry list, the class actually being registered, and the ordering.
The parameter list is an optional keyword argument which will almost
certainly be present.

  Once constructed, these objects can then easily by parametrized
through the GUI.  For a stand-alone dialog box, the registration's
parameter list can simply be passed to parameterwidgets.getParameters,
and it will return from the dialog box with new parameters.  A call to
the registration's __call__ method will instance the object.
Alternatively, the registration's parameter list can be passed to, or
shared with, an OOF menu item.  Invoking the menu item in non-GUI mode
will then set the parameters, prompting as required for those which
are not specified on the command-line, and supplying the last-set
value as the default. 

  In either case, once the parameters are set, the registration's
__call__ method can be invoked to instantiate the registered class.

  In the generic case, an instance constructed from a registration no
longer shares its parameters with the registration.  The
RegisteredClass base class provides functionality for extracting the
values from an instance in the form of a parameter list, provided the
instance has data members corresponding to each of the parameter
names.  Some care must be taken, depending on the context, to ensure
that values presented to users or set as defaults in menu items are
appropriate.


  The GUI Interface
  -----------------

  The parameterwidgets module provides several convenience functions for
bringing up widgets with which to parametrize objects.

  The RegisteredClassFactory object takes a registry and instantiates a
new GtkFrame, into which a GtkOptionMenu is placed, which has as
selections each of the classes.  For each class, the lower part of the
frame contains the appropriate widgets for the parameters of that
class.  This is the function you should use if you already have a
graphical background into which you wish to place your widgets.

  Alternatively, one can construct a ParameterDialog, which takes a list
of parameters and builds a GtkDialog with widgets for each of them.
This functionality can be generically operated in a modal way by
simply calling the "getParameters" function with the list of
parameters for which you require values.  getParameters has a return
code which indicates whether or not the user exited via the "OK"
button, which is the only circumstance under which the parameter
values will have changed.
