The switchboard allows parts of the program to tell other parts that
something of importance has happened, without having to know that
those other parts even exist.  One part of the program sends a message
through the switchboard, and other parts that have subscribed to that
message receive it, and can take appropriate actions.

In particular, the non-gui parts of the program use the switchboard to
tell the gui that something has changed, and that the gui needs to
update itself.  The non-gui can't just call the gui directly, since
the gui might not be running.  But there's no problem with issuing a
switchboard message even if nobody's listening to it.

The calls are:

switchboard.notify(message, args, ...)
  message is the message being sent, and args are extra arguments
  being sent along with it.  This is how a message is sent.

switchboard.requestCallback(message, callback)
  message is the message being sent, and callback is a function to be
  invoked when the message is received.  This is how a subscription is
  registered.  The arguments to the callback function are the
  additional arguments that were passed to notify().

  switchboard.requestCallback returns a _SwitchboardCallback object.

switchboard.removeCallback(callback)
  Unsubscribes to a message.  The argument is the _SwitchboardCallback
  object returned by requestCallback().

The _SwitchboardCallback object itself has two public methods, block()
and unblock(), which can be used to temporarily suppress and
unsuppress the callback.  The calls are cumulative -- a callback that
has been blocked x times requires x unblocks before it is
unsuppressed.

Messages:

The only restriction on messages is that they are hashable objects,
because they're stored in a dictionary.  In the simplest case,
messages are plain strings.  However in many cases it's useful to tie
messages to particular instances of objects, and to use an (object,
string) tuple.

Since messages allow communication between arbitrary parts of the
program, the set of messages in use is really global data.  When
adding a new message, it's important that it not conflict with
existing messages.  Therefore, all messages should be listed here.

This listing is one per line, so that it can be sorted easily.  To
learn the arguments to the callback, search the code for the notify()
call for the message.
