  Element Registration:

  This process has become  sufficiently complex that the info
should be localized somewhere.  This is the place.

  Why:
  
  In order to build a real mesh from a ghost mesh, you need
to put together the basic geometrical information (i.e. locations
of corners) that you've gotten from the mesh refinement process,
together with the details of element construction, which you
can deduce from knowing which type of element you want to actually
build (i.e. isoparametric, superparametric, subparametric, or 
user-defined custom specialization.)  The Element Registry mechanism
makes the second part available to a Python ghost mesh.
  Another objective of the design is to avoid duplication of 
information -- users may want to add new kinds of elements, and it's
easier, and less bug-prone, if all of the information can be provided
in at one level (the new element's .h and .C files).  If a few 
conventions are adhered to, the information will then be automatically
propagated up to the Python/ghostmesh level, without any artificial
duplication of data.

  The down-side of this is that the resulting automatic process is 
fairly complicated.  However, the complexity is "overhead complexity",
that is, although it's hard to get right, you only have to get it right
once, and then it works for everybody.  Users only need to understand
the interface in order to use it, and are not required to know the
mechanism (unless they want to, of course.)

  What: 

  The Element Registry is a global list of entries, one corresponding
to each available most-derived element class.  At present, there are
six.  An element registry entry has the name of the element type,
the number of nodes, and a list of prototype nodes.  Each prototype
node has information about whether the node is a parametric node or
a mapping node, where it is located in the element master space,
what its local index is relative to the current element, and 
which edges, if any, it belongs to.  All of this is to help the
ghost-mesh match up shared nodes of adjacent elements correctly.

  How:
  How to use:

  At the global level, you have, as a result of all the load-time
activity, access to a list of element registration entries from
Python, through the GetElementRegs() function call.  Each 
element of this list has a .name() method, which returns a string
which can be used to pick out the appropriate element type.

  At the python level, the element registry appears as a 
dictionary whose keys are the names of the registry entries,
as returned by the .name() call, and whose values are the
element registration entries themselves.  This is helpful
in coping with the fact that the order in which the registration
entires are built can vary depending on the compiler, build
parameters, and so forth, and is generally not guaranteed.

  To construct a real mesh from a ghost mesh, you must
provide a value for at least one of the keyword arguments,
"triangle" or "quad", to the mesh() method of the ghostmesh.
These values should of course be an element registration 
entry with the appropriate number of sides -- for instance,
you might do the following:

  e = GetElementRegs()
  etri = e['Isoparametric 3-node triangle']
  ghostmeshinstance.mesh(triangle=etri)

  ... in order to get a real mesh made up of three-noded
isoparametric triangular elements.

  Within ghostmesh.mesh, the first step is to construct all
of the known nodes -- these correspond to the corners of all the
ghost elements.   These are constructed using the appropriate 
mesh method (in this case, makeFuncNode).  Then, instantiate
an empty dictionary to hold the edge information, and iterate
over the ghost elements, calling each one's .realelement method
with the mesh, current master node count, edge dictionary, 
and the keyword argument set passed in to the ghostmesh's
mesh() method.  

  The realelement method will notice when it has to allocate new
nodes for an edge, and will add the edges to the edge dictionary as they
are created, and by this means, create all the necessary new
nodes for the shared edges of higher-order elements.

  How:
  How it works:

  There are two principal tasks that are complex enough that they
merit discussion.  They are the construction of the element registration
list, and the actual construction of an element.

  Construction of the list happens automatically at load-time through
various static functions belonging to the most-derived element class.
New elements must provide these functions and objects.

  How It Looks To An Element:

  The element should have a static private member of class ElementReg,
and static public functions to build the element, and return node
prototypes:
 
  static Element* builder(Material *, Node **);
  static ProtoNode* noder(int);

  The builder function is very simple, it just wraps the constructor.
A pointer to this function gets passed in to the element registration
entry, and the reason for the wrapping is that it's not possible to 
pass a pointer to the actual constructor.  
  The noder function is conceptually straightforward, but might
be fairly large for a many-noded element.  It takes an integer
argument that is a node index, and creates and populates a ProtoNode
structure corresponding to that index for the particular element
type, returning a pointer.  A pointer to this function also gets 
passed in to the element registry, and it gets called with each
possible index, up to the number of nodes, during the load-time
construction process.  The current noder functions are all switch
statements, with each block providing the unique information for
each node type, but any scheme that provides the correct information
would be fine, i.e. if an advanced user has a zillion-node element
where some devious scheme can be used to compute the node properties,
they could do that instead.

  From the point of view of the element code, the main event is 
the initialization of the static object of class ElementReg.  
The constructor takes four arguments:  A string which is the
name of this element class and which will be available from the
user interface, an integer equal to the number of nodes, 
a pointer to the builder function, and a pointer to the protonode
description function ("noder").  Because the ElementReg object is
static, the initialization occurs at load-time.

  How It Looks To The Registration Object:

  The ElementReg class itself of course has the constructor which 
is invoked at load-time for each of the static initializations which
occur.  The constructor fills in the appropriate data members 
from the arguments, and there are a few wrinkles here -- the "name"
goes into a private data member "name_" which is then made available
by function call.  This is an OOF coding convention adopted to avoid
confusion in other circumstances.  The number of nodes is a 
straightforwad assignment.  
  The "nodedescrip" function pointer is assigned to a private
member of the ElementReg class, because it only needs to be called
by the constructor -- any other call would result in the spurious
creation of ProtoNode instances, and a probable memory leak.  
The "builder" function pointer is public so that it can be called
from Python to actually build elements.  Although function pointers
cannot be called directly from Python, this particular function
is wrapped inside a SWIG "addmethod", where the function pointer
actually is available.
  Finally, at the end of the constructor, each element registration
entry adds itself to a global static list of them.  This list isn't
a "bare global", but rather is a static entity owned by a global
function which returns a reference to it.  This is a C++ trick to 
ensure that the required static member exists when it's needed, 
since the order of creation of static objects is not guaranteed,
but static members of functions are instantiated the first time
the flow of control passes through their declarations.

  How It Looks From Python:

  Half of the complexity here is in the .swg file,
with some wrapping happening in the _.py file, and most of it
revolves around Python/SWIG's inability to handle C++ templated
classes in general, and std::vector<Foo> in particular.
  The ProtoNode class object has "addmethod" wrappers for the
edge retrieval functions for this reason, but these are 
straightforward.

  There are two nodeworthy typemaps, one used to get the list
of element registrations out, and another used to get Python
lists of nodes in, where "out" and "in" are relative to the C++
code.  

  The "Eregvector" typemap is the one that gets the element
registration list out of C++ and into a proper Python list so 
it can be iterated over.  It's pattered after the node list 
typemap from the Boundary class, and has important semantic 
implications -- this typemap makes a local Python *copy* of 
the element registrations list, and does not use the SWIG 
shadow scheme.  This means that changes made to the local list
will not propagate anywhere.  This is a "read-only" object, except
that Python will not actually *prevent* you from writing to it,
so it ends up being "semantically read-only", so to speak.

  The "Node**" typemap is used to get a Python list of pointers
to c++ nodes into a C++ array.  Originally this was to be a 
std::vector<Node*>, but that proved to require too many layers
of indirection and copying, with potential performance implications
since every single element of an entire mesh is expected to be
built by this mechanism.  The typemap checks the size of the list,
and builds a null-terminated Node** into which to put the data.
The data appear in the form of SWIG pointers, which area strings
containing type information and a hexadecimal description of the
pointed-to address.  This string is extracted by the PyString_AsString
call, and then passed into SWIG_GetPtr to get back the actual 
corresponding C++ pointer-to-node, which can then be assigned
to the array, which in turn is then assigned to $target, which 
means that it shows up as the parameter "v" in the ElementReg's
"build" addmethod.  Note that the entire node list is copied in 
this process -- this is a potential performance concern, but
the objects being copied are pointers, so they're small, and the
copying overhead is thought to be small with respect to the 
weight of the PyString and GetPtr function calls, both of which
are mandatory parts of the conversion.  If a performance problem
arises, this issue will have to be revisted.

  As far *actual* *Python*, that's all in elementreg_.py, where
there are a couple of wrappers that preprocess the data.  These
are the functions that are actually called by the ghostmesh's
mesh construction routine, or will be when the time comes.
The Python functions are GetElementRegs(), which gets the element
registration list and maps the result through the ElementRegPtr
instantiation to convert the SWIG-Python strings-are-pointers to
proper objects with methods and so forth.  
  In fact, in order to increase the efficiency of the element 
construction process, the ElementRegPtr __init__ routine is not
trivial.  It has code which bridges the ease-of-coding requirement
for the ProtoNode class, which describes the element node-by-node,
with the ease-of-use requirement, which really wants to know which
nodes are relevant to a given edge.  The ElementRegPtr.__init__ 
routine defined in elementreg_.py overrides the SWIG default, and
builds a dictionary of lists of nodes.  The keys are the edge
numbers, with an additional special key, 'interior', for nodes
which are not on any edge.  Only nodes which are on exactly one or
zero edges are interesting, because the corner nodes are already
known to the ghost-mesh.  The value corresponding to each dictionary
key is just a list of node prototypes.  For the edges, these are in
counterclockwise order, and for the interior, they are in numerical
order according to their prototype local indices.  (UNTESTED)

  The other routine is the "build" routine, which 
does more or less the reverse wrapping -- it converts each of the
Node objects in the passed-in list into a C++-accessible
Node*, and assembles the entire list into a null-terminated
Node**, which is then passed on in to the C++ "build"
routine.  This level of indirection is required because 
SWIG is uncomfortable with pointers to functions.  The
"build" function itself is a generic-interface wrapper for
the constructor-wrapper.  This is really only a single
(extra) level of indirection, because the pointed-to 
function is not local to the ElementReg class, but rather
is the *element* class's constructor-wrapper.  It's just
that it's mentioned in several places.
