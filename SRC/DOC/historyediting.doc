How to create editable histories, as in the Image Modification pane of
the ImagePage or the PixelSelection toolbox


History editing allows the user to flip through the recently performed
operations, possibly modifying and repeating them.  History editing is
only available in GUI mode, because Python command line editing is
available in CLI mode.

The operations being stored in the history have to belong to a
RegisteredClass, and have to be set from a RegisteredClassFactory.
The GUI should construct "Prev", "OK", and "Next" buttons below the
factory.  (The names can be changed, obviously, if there's a really
good reason.)  The GUI also needs to construct a Historian, which is
documented in common/IO/GUI/historian.py.  The RegisteredClassFactory
and the Historian need to know about each other, so the initialization
sequence should look like this:

        self.imageModFactory = parameterwidgets.RegisteredClassFactory(
            imagemodifier.ImageModifier.registry, title="Method:")

        self.historian = historian.Historian(self.imageModFactory.set,
                                             self.sensitizeHistory)

        self.imageModFactory.set_callback(self.historian.stateChangeCB)

The factory's callback is called whenever its GktOptionMenu is
changed, and the Historian needs to know about this, so the factory's
callback must be set to the Historian's stateChangeCB function.  If
the factory needs to do other things in its callback, its callback
can call historian.stateChangeCB() directly.  stateChangeCB() takes
generic *args arguments and ignores them.

The second argument to the Historian constructor is a callback telling
the GUI that the sensitivity of the Prev and Next buttons has
changed.  The GUI can use Historian.nextSensitive() and
Historian.prevSensitive() to see if the buttons should be sensitive or
not.

The RegisteredClassFactory has to be updated whenever a new
Registration is created, with a switchboard request connected to an
update function:

    def updateImageModifiers(self):
        self.imageModFactory.update(ImageModifier.registry)

    switchboard.requestCallback(ImageModifier, self.updateImageModifiers)

The CLI menu for the operations should be constructed from the
Registrations, and should be reconstructed whenever a new Registration
is created, to guarantee consistency when new modules are loaded.  As
an example, the Image.Modify menu construction is reasonably generic:

    imagemodmenu = mainmenu.OOF.Image.addItem(oofmenu.OOFMenuItem('Modify'))

    def buildImageModMenu():
	imagemodmenu.clearMenu()
	for registration in imagemodifier.ImageModifier.registry:
	    params = [ <additional arguments> ] + registration.params
	    menuitem = imagemodmenu.addItem(
		oofmenu.OOFMenuItem(registration.name(),
				    callback=imagemodifier.doImageMod,
				    params=params))
	    menuitem.data = registration

    switchboard.requestCallback(imagemodifier.ImageModifier,
				buildImageModMenu)

The switchboard callback will be called automatically whenever a new
subclass of ImageModifier is registered.  Note that the Registration
is stored in the OOFMenuItem's data field, and that additional
arguments, not present in the Registration, can be added to the
parameter list of the menu item.  For image modification, the
extra argument is the image name.

The OK button's GUI callback must get the Registration from the
RegisteredClassFactory, copy the values from the GUI widgets into the
Registration's params, and call the corresponding CLI menu item.  In
the ImagePage, the ImageModification menu is constructed from the
Registrations, so the OK button callback looks like this:
 
    def okbuttonCB(self, button):
        modmeth = self.imageModFactory.currentOption # Registration
        if modmeth is not None:
            self.imageModFactory.set_defaults() # copy params from widgets
            menuitem = getattr(mainmenu.OOF.Image.Modify, modmeth.name())
            menuitem.callWithDefaults( <additional arguments> )

callWithDefaults() works because the Registration and the OOFMenuItem
*share* their params! 

The CLI menu item performs the operation by instancing the
RegisteredClass and doing whatever is required to do something with
it.  (In the case of image modifications, this means calling the
ImageModifier's __call__ method.)  For history editing, the important
point is that the CLI callback must also issue a switchboard call
telling the GUI which operation has been performed.  Here's the
relevant part of the image modification OOFMenuItem callback:

    def doImageMod(menuitem, image, **params):
        # Extract the registration from the menuitem
	registration = menuitem.data

	# Instantiate the RegisteredClass object.  The menu was
	# constructed so that its params are exactly those needed for
	# the RegisteredClass.
	imageModifier = apply(registration, (), params)

	< Here's where the actual operation is performed. >

	switchboard.notify('modified image', imageModifier)

But first, the GUI has to request that it be informed about the
operation.  For example, the ImagePage requests that it be told about
the 'modified image' notification in its __init__:
    
    switchboard.requestCallback('modified image', self.modifiedImageCB)

Notice that the corresponding switchboard.notify call in the CLI
callback has passed the RegisteredClass instance as an argument.  The
GUI's switchboard callback then has to tell the Historian about it:

    def modifiedImageCB(self, imageModifier):
        self.historian.record(imageModifier)


Finally, the GUI has to sensitize and desensitize the Next and Prev
buttons in the callback that it passed to the Historian constructor:

    def sensitizeHistory(self):
        self.nextmethodbutton.set_sensitive(self.historian.nextSensitive())
        self.prevmethodbutton.set_sensitive(self.historian.prevSensitive())
