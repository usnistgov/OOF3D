The Care and Feeding of Boundary Conditions
-------------------------------------------

Boundary conditions data are separated into three pieces in OOF.  The
geometric information, about where in space the boundary lies, is in
the Boundary class, of which there are two types, an EdgeBoundary and
a PointBoundary.  The EdgeBoundary supports integration, but can be
represented as a set of nodes, and supports fixed, floating, and flux
boundary conditions.  The PointBoundary is a set of nodes, and cannot
in general be converted to an EdgeBoundary, and supports fixed, float,
and force boundary conditions.  The boundary conditions themselves
contain information about which global fields they apply to, and in
the case of fixed and float conditions, which equations they make
dependent, that is to say, which components of which forces should be
used to enforce the boundary condition.  Flux and force boundary
conditions apply forces either indirectly (by specifying the flux on
an edge) or directly, respectively.  The third piece is the "profile
function", which specifies the values associated with the boundary
condition, i.e. for a fixed displacment along some edge, the profile
function tells you what the displacments actually are.  Profiles can
be discrete or continuous, with the former intended to be used by
PointBoundary objects, and the latter by EdgeBoundary objects.


The logical structure of all of this is that the boundary owns an
object which contains both a boundary condition and a profile.  From
the point of view of the user (or author of the UI), it is possible to
specify and re-use profiles and boundary conditions, although at the
implementation level, the actual references used by the boundaries are
to local copies.


Applying Boundary Conditions:  A Fixed Boundary Example

Before you can make and apply a boundary condition, there are some
prerequisites.  OOF physics is made of fields (like displacement) and
equations (like forcebalance) which have to be paired up.  It's fairly
obvious that you have to pick. e.g. a field to fix, but it's perhaps
less obvious that you also have to pick an equation to make dependent
-- fixing a field implies allowing some boundary reaction-force to
take on whatever value is necessary in order to push the fixed field
to the selected value.  Besides the field to fix and the force to fix
it with, you also have to pick the values to which the field should be
fixed, and the geometrical object (that is, the boundary) on which the
fixing should take place.  Everything except the actual condition
presupposes the existence of an OOF2 mesh to which these things can be
applied.

The sequence of commands, for the simple case of a fixed boundary
condition fixing both components of a displacment field, is given
below.

( 1) Construct a mesh, presumed here to have the name "mesh", with
     defined field "displacement" and equation "forcebalance_eqn".

( 2) Define a profile function.  We want to fix the displacments 
     to all be zero, so we do:

     profile_zero = ContinuumProfile('0.0')

( 3) Define the actual boundary condition for each compnent:

     fixeddisp_x = mesh.newFixedBC(displacement, 0, forcebalance_eqn, 0)
     fixeddisp_y = mesh.newFixedBC(displacement, 1, forcebalance_eqn, 1)

( 4) Make the boundary.  The mesh maintains a dictionary of all
     boundaries.  By calling newEdgeBoundary with a key, you create
     an empty boundary, which you can then populate with edges.
     If you already have an EdgeSet object for this boundary, you can
     pass it in as the second argument, but this is not required.
       Edges are added by calling the new boundary's addEdge method.
     bottom_bdy = mesh.newEdgeBoundary('bottom_bdy')
     bottom_bdy.addEdge(edge0)
     bottom_bdy.addEdge(edge1)
     ... etc

( 5) Add your boundary conditions, with profiles, to the boundary:

     bottom_bdy.addFixedCondition( fixeddisp_x, profile_zero)
     bottom_bdy.addFixedCondition( fixeddisp_y, profile_zero)

( 6) Run the equilibration.

The mesh's equilibration routine will poll the boundaries prior to
solving the matrix, and will ask each boundary to apply its conditions
in the appropriate order, after checking to make sure they are all
consistent.  You can get errors from this process if, for instance,
you have accidentally specified that the same point be fixed in two
places, due to intersecting fixed boundary conditions with different
profile function.  If you make a floating boundary condition intersect
with a fixed boundary condition, applied to the same component of the
same field, the solver will automatically promote the floating
boundary condition to a fixed one, adding an offset to the flaoting
boundary condition's profile function as required to ensure
consistency.

The foregoing is a simple example, but demonstrates the essential
features of the process.  A more detailed description of the different
kinds of boundaries, boundary conditions, and profile objects, is below.


The Sequence of Events:

After building the global stiffness matrix for the whole,
unconstrained problem, the mesh's equilibration routine first calls
mesh.bcPromote() several times, until it reports that no floating
boundary conditions have been promoted to fixed boundary conditions.
This is necessary because the promotion of one floating boundary
condition to fixed may create a new float/fixed intersection,
requiring additional promotions.  After that, the mesh then calls
mesh.fixedBCConsistency(), which runs through all the fixed boundary
conditions and compares their profile functions at intersections.  If
any inconsistencies are found, an excpetion is thrown.  If not, the
boundary condition set is consistent.

Actual invocation of the boundary conditions takes place prior to
equilibration.  The equilibrate() routine iterates through all of the
boundaries several times, first asking each one to apply all of its
flux boundary conditions, then fixed, then force.  Fixed boundary
conditions simply mark the appropriate nodal degrees of freedom as
fixed, and apply a particular value to the appropriate degree of
freedom, stored in the Node structure.  Flux and force boundary
conditions make contributions to the mesh's boundary_rhs vector, which
is used to separate boundary-condition contributions to the rhs from
other cnotributions.  Then, the matrix extraction maps are built --
these are the mapping vectors which indicate which rows of the matrix
correspond to dependent or independent force equations, and which
columns of the matrix correspond to fixed and free degrees of freedom.
At this point in the process, these maps take each row/column of the
main stiffness matrix to exactly one row/column of the target.  The
boundaries are iterated through one final time to invoke their
floating boundary conditions, which operate on the maps to merge the
floated degrees of freedom together.  At the same time, in the case of
a nontrivial profile function, the floating boundary makes
compensating force contributions to the boundary_rhs vector.  After
the float BC invocation, it's necessary for the mesh to call
"cleanlists", to ensure that the target space of the mapping lists
(which gets modified by the float BC's) is a contiguous series of
integers starting from zero.

It is at this point that the matrix is actually solved -- the
submatrix corresponding to free degrees of freedom and independent
force equations is extracted and solved, and the dependent forces and
fixed degrees of freedom are back-substituted.  Finally, it is
necessary to expand the floating boundary conditions, that is, use the
floating boundary condition's profile data, along with the offset
determined from the equilibration process, to make the actual
degree-of-freedom assignments.

That is the core of the process.  Some of the individual events are
quite complicated, because of the need to handle different kinds of
profiles and different kinds of boundaries in a transparent way.  Note
in particular that the EdgeBoundary class has a no-op stub which gets
called when force boundary conditions are being implemented, and the
PointBoundary class has a corresponding no-op stub for the flux
boundary conditions.


Floating Boundary Conditions:

  A "Floating" boundary condition is an edge, or equivalently
a set of nodes, which are constrained to move together in a 
particular degree of freedom, but which are not constrainted to
any particular value.  These used to be called "enslaved" degrees
of freedom in OOF1.
 
The calling interface is the same as the Fixed boundary condition.
You need a field, a component, an equation and a component.  As of
now, only one component of this can be defined at a time.  The profile
should be appropriate to the type of boundary you're putting it on.
The principal difference between float boundary conditions and fixed
boundary conditions is that the profile function for a float boundary
condition only specifies the degrees of freedom up to an overall
constant.


Flux Boundary Conditions:

Flux boundary conditions differ importantly from both fixed and
floating boundary conditions.  The profile function must specify the
normal component of a flux, and will therefore in general be
multidimensional.  For reasons having to do with controlling the
logistical complexity of the Python call-back, the profile which
specifies this flux component should return a tuple of floating-point
values, rather than returning scalars separately.  This heterogeneity
of the interface is a bit clunky, but can be shielded from the user by
means of another interface layer, if required.  Note that the
requirement to specify all components of a flux's normal component
does not result in any loss of generality, since applying zero force
in a particular component is of course equivalent to not applying any
force.  

Aside from that difference, because the flux boundary condition is
integrated, it can only be applied to an EdgeBoundary, so the profile
should of course be a ContinuumProfile or NormalProfile.  The Flux BC
itself only specifies which flux's normal component is being set.
Syntactically, the condition specification is the same as that for the
other boundary conditions.


Force Boundary Conditions:

In a sense, this is the point-wise version of the flux boundary
condition.  The reason it has a separate name is not only because of
the differences in the interface, but also to emphasize the important
conceptual difference between the two -- they are dimensionally
distinct, a force boundary condition specifies forces corresponding to
particular equations in the system applied at particular nodes,
whereas a flux boundary condition specifies an object that must be
integrated to determine the forces.  

Force boundary conditions can only be applied to PointBoundaries, and
therefore must be described by DiscreteProfile objects.  They are
otherwise syntactically similar to the other kinds of boundary
conditions.  You may specify only one component of a force.


Implementation Details:
-----------------------


EdgeBoundary:

The EdgeBoundary is the "usual" boundary -- it specifies a geometry
that is made up of several edges of elements.  It's a Python object
that has a C++ "EdgeSet" as a data member.  EdgeSet objects can
iterate over their edges, for integration, or can present all of their
FuncNodes, including intermediate FuncNodes that appear in the middle
of the edges.  The EdgeSet's node-presentation method guarantees that
each node will occur exactly once in the list, irrespective of the
actual EdgeSet geometry, and promises that the order in which the
nodes occur will be consistent from one call to the next, but doesn't
have any obvious relationship to any kind of traversal order.  Like
the PointBoundary, it has methods to assign conditions to itself,
which it does by instanting a new BCInstance object, which couples a
condition and a profile together.  The BCInstance initializer is the
object which makes the local copies of the profile and boundary
conditions.  It is an error to try to add a ForceCondition to an
EdgeBoundary, but all other conditions are permitted.

Float and Fixed boundary conditions are invoked by individual calls
for each node in the EdgeSet, accompanied by the profile function
evaluated at the coordinates of the node.  Only ContinuumProfiles and
NormalProfiles such an evaluation entry point, which is why they have
to be used with EdgeSets.  Flux conditions are evaluated by passing
the profile itself to the FluxBC's "invoke" routine, along with the
EdgeSet object.  The FluxBC itself then iterates over the EdgeSet,
integrating over Gausspoints as described in more detail below.
Relevant here is the fact that this interface requires that the
profile be Python-callable, and that it return a tuple with the
correct number of elements for the normal component of the specified
flux.


PointBoundary:

A PointBoundary is made up of a number of FuncNodes with no mandatory
geometrical relationship to each other -- they could be corners, they
could lie on an edge, they could be special interior points, and there
may be any number of them, including zero, although it's a lot of
effort for nothing if you do that.  The nodes themselves are stored in
the local nodeset data member, which is expected to be a dictionary,
or at least to act like a dictionary.  (In practice, actual testing
examples used a NodeSet object, which in addition to normal dictionary
functions, also has an addNode method that provides uniformity of
interface at the mesh level.)

PointBoundary objects have mostly the same entry points as
EdgeBoundary objects.  It is an error to try to add a FluxCondition to
a PointBoundary, but all others are allowed.  All conditions are
evaluated on a node-by-node basis, with the value being retrieved by
key (corresponding to the current node's key) from the
DiscreteProfile.


PointBoundary and EdgeBoundary methods:
getFloatGeometry and getFixedGeometry:

These special routines exist to support intersection detection and
consistency checking.  In order to facilitate the search for matching
nodes, these routines return a dictionary of all the nodes in the
boundary, indexed by the nodes themselves.  The values corresponding
to the keys in this dictionary are lists of LocatedCondition objects.

The "LocatedCondition" contains the boundary condition, and enough
information to evaluate the condition's profile object at the current
location, whether specified by key or coordinate, on demand.  The
reason for this is that it defers the profile evaluation until and
unless an actual intersection is found -- there is no point in
evaluating the profile functions of a large boundary many times just
in case an intersection arises, and we want to leave open the
possibility that, in complicated cases, boundary profile functions may
be very expensive.  LocatedCondition objects also present a uniform
interface for evaluating the profile -- they have a __call__ method
which detects which kind of evaluation is appropriate and performs it
correctly, so the caller (i.e. the intersection checker) doesn't need
to know whether the intersection is between PointBoundaries,
EdgeBoundaries, or both.  The LocatedCondition evauator also applies
offsets to the profile, which may be required, for instance, in the
case of a fixed boundary condition which has an offset because it's
derived from a previously-intersecting floating boundary condition,
and now intersects with another floating boundary condition.

Each of the getXGeometry entry points returns a nontrivial result only
if the specified boundary conditions (i.e. fixed or float) are present
on the boundary.


BCInstance:

This object is pretty simple, the primary noteworthy feature is that
it takes a condition and a profile, and makes a local copy to assign
to its data members.  This is so that at the higher level, you can
define a profile or a boundary condition once, and then assign it
multiple times to various boundaries in whatever combinations work.
Then, if the profile later gets specialized somehow, it will only be
specialized locally.


DiscreteProfile, ContinuumProfile, and NormalProfile:

These are the objects that tell the boundary how to get a value to
pass to the boundary condition's invocation routine.  The two kinds of
profiles differ in their approach to function evaluation, but work in
basically the same way -- the thing you input is generally a string
describing a function of x and y.  At evaluation time, x and y are
substituted with the actual coordinates at which the evaluation is
taking place, and the function is evaluated in the restricted name
space.  The reason for making it a string is twofold, firstly because
it simplifies the restricted evaluation, and secondly because it gives
you access to any other functions or constants you may have predefined
elsewhere in the restricted name space by some other mechanism.  For
instance, if you're doing a parametric study on some small
displacement "delta", you can set "delta" in the restricted name
space, and then refer to it in your boundary condition profiles.

Note that the existence of a __call__ method means that the profile
object iself is Python-callable.  This handy feature is used by the
Flux boundary condition to do integration.  As previously remarked,
profiles used by Flux boundary conditions should return tuples of
values whose length is the dimensionality of the flux normal.

ContinuumProfiles are characterized by a single string, which is the
only argument to the initializer.  DiscreteProfiles are more
complicated -- their internal structure is that of a dictionary, with
keys corresponding to the node keys in a PointBoundary, and values
that are either strings or functions.  The DiscreteProfile does the
same thing for either __call__ or __getitem__ evaluation, so you can
use it like a dictionary of keys, or a function of the keys, and it
will work the same way.  

The NormalProfile object behaves like a ContinuumProfile object, with
a few additional constraints -- besides the x and y location, it also
expects the direction of the local normal to the boundary in question,
in the variables nx and ny.  If the value returned by the function
associated with the NormalProfile is a two-element tuple, it is
rotated so that its y component points along ny, and its x component
points along nx before being returned to the caller.  This has the
effect of evaluating the vector-valued function in "normal
coordinates."  The orientation convention is that the positive y axis
is the outward normal from the bounded region (presumed to be on the
right as the boundary is traversed), and the positive x direction is
tangent to the boundary and points in the direction of traversal.

The DiscreteProfile dictionary can either be passed in, in which case
it's up to the caller to ensure that the functions are
evaluation-safe, or the DiscreteProfile object can be created empty,
and have elements added to the dictionary via a series of either
addValue (takes a key and a string, adds a function) or addLiteral
(takes a key and a constant) calls.


FixedBC:

The basic task of the FixedBC object is to make an assignment of a
particular value to a nodal degree of freedom, and mark the
corresponding equation component as dependent.  The fields and
equations provide interfaces that do this, so it's just a matter of
calling them.  There is no C++ code in this one, and it gets called
node-by-node with the appropriate values.  After the degrees of
freedom and equations are marked, the resulting flags are used to
construct the mapping lists.  Therefore, fixed degrees of freedom must
be applied before this mapping is done.

FloatBC:

The floating boundary conditions are of intermediate complexity, more
than fixed but less than flux.  The Python FluxBC object, when
invoked, creates a C++ applicator for itself, which then gets called
with the sets of nodes and values.  The applicator is stateful, and
will recognize it's first call, which it will use to determine the
target value from the equation and degree of freedom maps to which all
subsequent calls will be mapped.  Later calls then make these changes
to the list, as well as modfying the right hand side (boundary
contribution) to allow for nontrivial profile functions.  Obviously,
the DOF and equation maps must exist prior to the invocation of
floating boundary conditions.

After solution, the floating boundary conditions must be expanded.
Because the solver has no access to the profile functions, it can't
put different values in the different, summed degrees of freedom.
Instead, the solver puts the same value in all of them, and the
FloatBC's "expand" routine corrects them as required.  The value
returned by the solver is such that the sum of all of the degrees of
freedom is correct.  Since the sum of the profile function is also
known to the FloatBC, the actual values for the degrees of freedom
must be values wich differ from each other according to the profile
function, and sum to the total retrieved from the solver.  This is
achieved by placing in each DOF a value equal to the difference
between the profile function at that point and the difference between
the sums.


ForceBC:

The ForceBC is an elaborate way of making a single assignment to a
particular element of the boundary's contribution to the
right-hand-side.  Logistically it resembles a FixedBC, and does more
or less the same thing, i.e. making an assignment, but it turns out to
be more convenient in this case to make the assignment in C++.  Data
members are just the equation and equation component, and the __call__
routine creates a simple C++ applicator object and calls its set_rhs
method.  Like the comment says, most of the class is a life-support
system for a single line of C++ code. 

This might be worth moving up to Python.


FluxBC:

The Flux boundary condition is the most C-intensive of the boundary
conditions, as it has to do actual integration over gausspoints.  The
starting point for all of this is the FluxBC::integrate routine,
located in boundarycond.swg.  This routine invokes the Python-callable
object typemap from oof.swg, and then calls the internal integrate_()
routine.  The execution pathway mimics that of the stiffness-matrix
construction process.  For each edge in the EdgeSet, the routine
iterates over GaussPoints, bumping the integration order up to an
arbitrary 3 more than that deduced from the order of the shape
functions.  It then calls the boundary_integral method of the
specified flux, which loops over applicable equations, calling *their*
boundary_integral routines, which in turn call back to the flux's
local_boundary routine to populate an appropriate right-hand-side
object, which is the analogue of the local stiffness matrix, and then
assign it to the boundary's contribution to the right-hand-side.

The flux's local_boundary routine executes the Python callback by
calling the particular flux's BCCallback method.  This method is
actually defined in boundarycond.swg, because this allows for all the
Python interface code and accompanying helper functions and utility
declarations to appear in SWIG files.  This is where/why the
Python-callable profile object has to return a tuple, for those of you
who were wondering.


Mesh methods:

A number of features of the Mesh class support the operation of the
boundary conditions.  First and foremost among these is the existence
of the vector boundary_right_side, which stores the boundary
contributions to the right-hand side separately from the nodal
equation values, which are used in the computation of body forces or
other "intrinsic" RHS contributions.  The boundary_right_side vector
is added to the other right-hand-side contributions during the
equilibration process in the get_rhs routine.  Within the mesh class,
the boundary_right_side vector can be accessed and manipulated through
the boundary_rhs_init, dump_boundary_rhs, and bounadry_rhs methods,
which initialize, write, and retrieve it, respectively.  The
cleanlists() routine, mentioned above in the context of the floating
boundary condition, is a C++ method of the Mesh class.

On the Python side, probably the most important and useful mesh-based
boundary routine is the BCStatus method.  Called with no arguments, it
dumps the current boundary set, with conditions.  

The fixed-boundary condition consistency checker and the
floating-boundary condition intersection and promotion routine are
also present at this level.  These routines are a little on the
complicated side, primarily because of the way the boundary conditions
are organized -- a fairly large number of checks have to take place
before you know for sure that you actually do have an intersection.
The geometry must match, and at each geometric intersection, the
general case is that you have several conditions associated with the
node for each boundary of which it (the node) is a member, so you have
to check all of the conditions from one against all of the conditions
from the other, while at the same time making sure you are working
with the correct profile function.  A lot of the complexity is rolled
in to the LocatedCondition object, which can simply be evaluated to
get the appropriate profile value.  The fixedBCConsistency and
bcPromote routines themselves consist primarily of several nested
loops and conditionals.  They differ in two principal ways, the first
being that fixedBCConsistency, comparing fixed conditions against
other fixed conditions, only needs to look at each pair of boundaries
once.  bcPromote, on the other hand, is looking at the fixed condition
from the "first" boundary and the float condition from the "second",
and so needs to look at each pair of boundaries from both points of
view.  The second principal difference is in the innermost loop -- the
consistency routine simply throws an exception the first time it
encounters any inequality in the profile functions, whereas the
bcPromote routine promotes a floating boundary condition at the first
possible opportunity.

Note that, because boundaries can intersect multiple times, it's
possible that a promoted floating boundary condition, made consistent
at the first point of intersection by the choice of a suitable offset
for the profile function, might become inconsistent at a second
intersection point.  In this case, the promotion process will result
in an inconsistent set of *fixed* boundary conditions.  This is why
bcPromote should be run to completion *before* fixedBCConsistency is
run, otherwise inconsistencies might sneak through the promotion
mechanism.


Output:

In addition to the routines supporting construction and invocation of
boundary conditions on boundaries, there are also routines for writing
out the boundaries and boundary conditions into a log or status file,
such that reading that file back in will recreate the same boundaries
and conditions.  No consistency checking is done in this case, so that
intermediate, unsolvable constructions which might nevertheless be
useful starting points can be saved.

Writing out the complete set of boundaries begins with calling the
mesh's boundary condition reset function, to reset the variable-name
counter, as well as to remove any fixed boundary conditions which
resulted from the promotion of floating boundaries, and remove offsets
in fixed boundary conditions which intersect with other fixed boundary
condtions.  After that, each boundary should write its creation
command by calling write_create with a file name, indentation string,
dictionary key from the mesh's boundary dictionary, and a meshname.
This funciton will return an automatically-generated variable name
which can be used to refer to the boundary elsewhere in the file.

After the creation command has been written, and after all elements
and nodes have been created, it is safe to call each boundary's
write_geometry method, which writes out the commands necessary to
rebuild the boundary geometry, using integer indices to refer to the
nodes and elements.  Finally, after the appropriate fields and
equations are known to be defined, you can call each boundary's
write_conditions method.  This sequence -- creation, geometry, and
conditions -- results in a complete description of the boundaries.
