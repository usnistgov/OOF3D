1.1 The logger for gtk.ComboBox now records the string stored in
    current value, if possible.  If underlying model for the ComboBox
    isn't storing a string, then the logger records an integer row
    number (which is the old behavior).  The new method is more robust
    when new entries are added.

1.0 Initial released version.
