""" The classes in oofmenu.py describe the menus of commands that
represent all of the actions that OOF performs.  These menus form the
API between the guts of the program and the user interfaces, both
graphical (GUI) and command-line (CLI).  The menus can be used
directly in CLI mode, and can be automatically converted to GTK+ menus
in GUI mode.  [The code in this file defines only the menus and their
CLI interface.  The GUI interface is defined in common.IO.GUI.gfxmenu.
This file is independent of that one, although some of the comments
here may refer to it.]

The menu commands can be logged (scripted), either as they're
performed or as an afterthought.  The log file (script) can be read
back in to re-execute the commands.


----------------

To enforce the scriptability of all commands, all GUI and CLI commands
have to come from a common set of menus.  But in some circumstances, a
menu item may demand different actions in GUI and CLI modes.  For
example, the command "File/Open" should open a dialog box in GUI mode,
but should open a file in CLI mode.  These menu items must therefore
have two callbacks, one for each mode.  The GUI callback should not be
logged, since presumably it's not going to perform an action that
affects the state of the guts of the program; it's just going to open
a window in which the action will be performed.

----------------

The fundamental class is the OOFMenuItem.  This is the base class for
all OOF menu objects, even the menus.  That's because, as explained
above, some menus look like commands in some contexts.  OOFMenuItems
have the following constructor arguments:

name:         A string.  The string must be a valid Python identifier, because
              in CLI mode it will be typed to execute the command.
              That means that it must begin with an underscore or a
              letter and can contain only underscores, letters, and
              digits.  Because it's nice to have spaces in GUI mode,
              before being displayed in the GUI single underscores are
              turned into spaces and double underscores are turned
              into single underscores.

callback:     The function to be called when the command is executed
              in CLI mode.  The function takes at least one argument,
              which is the OOFMenuItem which caused it to be called.
              More arguments can be specified with the params
              constructor argument.  The callback argument is
              optional, but a menu item isn't much use if a callback
              isn't provided. [default value = None]

gui_callback: The function to be called when the menu item is chosen
              in GUI mode.  GUI callbacks take exactly one argument,
              which is the OOFMenuItem that invoked them.  If the
              non-GUI callback for the OOFMenuItem has no additional
              params, and if gui_callback is None, then the non-GUI
              callback will be invoked from the GUI.  If the non-GUI
              callback does have params, but no GUI callback is provided,
              then a simple dialog box is created allowing the params to
              be set. [default value = None]

accel:	      A string describing the keyboard accelerator to be used
              in GUI mode.  The string must be a key symbol defined in
              GDK.py.  For example, accel='d' makes Alt-D the
              accelerator.  accel='equal' makes Alt-= the
              accelerator.  [default value = None]

secret:	      If secret=0, then the menu item is visible.  If secret=1, the
              menu item is not displayed in either GUI or CLI mode.
              However, explicitly requesting the display of a secret
              menu will display it.  This allows all of the OOF menus
              to live in a single menu hierarchy.  For example,
              OOF.Graphics.gfx_1 is a secret menu in the main Graphics
              menu, and contains the menu for the first graphics
              window.  That menu is actually displayed in the graphics
              window, because it was explicitly created with
              gfxmenu.gtkOOFMenuBar(OOF.Graphics.gfx1).  [default value
              = 0]
              
ellipsis:     If ellipsis=1, then the item's name has '...' appended to it
              when displayed. [default value = 0]
              
help:	      A helpful string.  Appears in tooltips.

discussion:   A longer helpful string.  It should be a series of xml
              elements legal for the body of a DocBook refsect1 element.

params:	      A list of Parameters that are provided as arguments to
              the non-GUI callback function.  The Parameter class is
              defined in commmon.IO.parameter.  The callback will be
              called with additional keyword arguments, one for each
              parameter, using Parameter.name and Parameter.value for
              the key and value.  [default value = []]

help_menu:    If help_menu=1, then this item is presumed to be a 'Help'
              menu and will be right justified in a GUI menu bar.  Setting
              help_menu=1 on anything other than a plain old OOFMenuItem with
              no callback doesn't make any sense, and may cause confusion.

ordering:     New items are added to menus just before the first item with
              a larger ordering number.  Items with the same ordering number
              appear in the order in which they're added. [default value=0]

Options:      Any additional keyword arguments to the OOFMenuItem
              constructor are options that apply to the menu item and
              to all its children (unless overridden in a child).  The
              allowed options are listed in _allowed_options, and are:
	        gui_only:  items appear only in GUI mode
		cli_only:  items appear only in CLI mode
		no_log:	   items are not logged
                no_doc:    items don't appear in documentation
	      If an option is not provided, its value is taken from
	      the menu items parent.

Functions:

root():	  Returns the root of the menu hierarchy.

log(string):  Adds the given string to the log.

add_gui_callback(function):  Assigns a separate callback to be use in gui mode.
                             The callback function takes a single
                             argument, which is the menu item.

Data:

data:	  This is just a convenient spot for storing any additional
          data that might need to be passed through to the callbacks.
          OOFMenuItem.data is not used by the OOFMenu classes.


Menus:

There used to be a separate class, named 'OOFMenu', derived from
OOFMenuItem.  That was deemed to be a mistake, and now there's no
distinction between menus and menu items, except that menus are menu
items that have subitems assigned to them.  The following functions
act on subitems:

addItem(item):  Adds a previously constructed OOFMenuItem to the menu.

getItem(name):  Returns the menuitem with the given name.

removeItem(name):  Removes the menuitem with the given name from the
                   menu. 

makeGroup():  Creates a group for radio menu items.  See
              RadioOOFMenuItem below.

apply(f):    Applies the function f to all OOFMenuItems in the hierarchy.
             (Remember that OOFMenus are OOFMenuItems, too.)  The first
             argument to f() is the OOFMenuItem.  Additional arguments to
             apply() are passed on as additional arguments to f().
             This function is used by the text menu dumping command.
             
-----------------------------

There are three special derived types of OOFMenuItem: OOFRootMenu,
CheckOOFMenuItem, RadioOOFMenuItem.

---------

OOFRootMenu:

The root of the menu hierarchy must be an OOFRootMenu instance.
OOFRootMenu is derived from OOFMenuItem, and adds the following
functions:

addLogger(logger):  Adds a new logging method.  'logger' must be a
              callable object that takes a string as an argument.  See
              MenuLogger, below.   More than one logging method can be
              active at once.

removeLogger(logger): Stops logging with the given logging method.

saveLog(file):  Write the internal log to a file.  file must be a
                Python file object, or something that looks like one.

clearLog():  Clears the internally maintained log.

haltLog():  Temporarily suspend logging.

resumeLog(): Resume logging after haltLog().  Each call to haltLog()
             must be matched by a call to resumeLog() before logging
             will actually resume.

When commands are logged, they are logged as Python expressions, like
"rootmenu.menu.submenu.etc.function(arg=...)".  The names of the
menus, submenus, and functions are the 'name' attributes of the
corresponding OOFMenuItems.  Therefore, the logged menu commands are
accessible in a script only if the script is executed in an
environment in which the root menu's name (as a Python reference) is
the same as its name attribute.


----------

Return values:

Menu commands do not return results -- they only change the state of
the system by the actions of their callbacks.  This makes it safe to
launch a menu callback on a subthread, and then proceed to launch
others on other threads without having to wait.

  
----------

CheckOOFMenuItem:

A CheckOOFMenuItem is an OOFMenuItem that has a value, which can be 0
or 1.  In GUI mode, a check box is drawn next to the menu item's name,
indicating the value.  A CheckOOFMenuItem can have no params.  Its
constructor has one additional argument, value, which is the item's
initial value.  The callback for a CheckOOFMenuItem has two arguments,
the calling CheckOOFMenuItem, and the value.  A CheckOOFMenuItem can
have no separately specified gui_callback.

-----------

RadioOOFMenuItem:

A RadioOOFMenuItem is a CheckOOFMenuItem that lives in a group.  One
item in the group has value=1.  All the others have value=0.  The
constructor takes one additional argument, group, which must be a
group returned from OOFMenu.makeGroup().  When a RadioOOFMenuItem is
executed, its callback is called with value=1, but first the callbacks
for all other items in the group are called with value=0, if they had
value=1.

----------------------------------

GUI callbacks:

Every object in the GUI that corresponds to a change in the state of
the OOF guts should have a corresponding menu item, so that it can be
scripted.  But it is common for the GUI to have many widgets that set
values that aren't used until some other widget is activated.  Here's
an example:

The filename input widget in a file selector dialog box isn't used
until the "OK" button is pressed.  So the filename input widget should
not correspond to a menu item.  Furthermore, the File/Open menu item
should correspond to a logged command in the CLI:
root.file.open(filename=name) but should simply open a window in the
GUI.  Therefore, the OOFMenuItem for file.open must have two
callbacks.  It might be constructed like this:

fileopen = OOFMenuItem('open',
                       callback=cli_fileopen_callback,
		       gui_callback = gui_fileopen_callback,
		       params=[StringParameter('filename')])
                                    
The CLI callback looks like this:

def cli_fileopen_callback(menuitem, filename):
   file = open(filename, "r")
   [whatever...]

The first argument, menuitem, is a reference to fileopen, the calling
OOFMenuItem.   The second argument is the first (and only, in this
case) Parameter from the params list in the OOFMenuItem constructor.

The GUI callback looks like this:

def gui_fileopen_callback(menuitem):
   fname = graphical_way_of_getting_filename()
   menuitem(filename=fname)

The last line calls the CLI callback, setting the filename argument to
the fname obtained by the GUI.  It's important to call the CLI
callback in this way, rather than invoking it directly, so that the
call can be logged.


Here's another example:

Imagine a menu item 'Dessert' that, in GUI mode opens a window on
which there are two buttons, 'Pie' and 'Cake'.  In the CLI mode,
however, 'Dessert' is a menu containing two items, 'Pie' and 'Cake'.
So the OOFMenuItem 'Dessert' needs to be an OOFMenu, constructed like
this:

dessert = OOFMenu('Dessert', callback=None, gui_callback=dessert_gui)
dessert.addItem(OOFMenuItem('Pie', callback=pie, cli_only=1))
dessert.addItem(OOFMenuItem('Cake', callback=cake, cli_only=1))

Note that the subitems are marked 'cli_only' so that they don't appear
in the GUI menu.

The CLI callbacks are straightforward:

def pie(menuitem): print "Yummm, pie!"

def cake(menuitem): print "Yummm, cake!"

The gui_callback for dessert creates a window and remembers the
OOFMenuItem that created it:

def dessert_gui(menuitem):
    gui = DessertGUI(menuitem)
   
class DessertGUI:
    def __init__(self, menuitem):
        self.menuitem = menuitem
        window = create_dessert_window(self.pie_button_cb, self.cake_button_cb)
	window.show()

The callbacks for the buttons in the GUI now can call the non-GUI callbacks:
    def pie_button_cb(self):
        self.menuitem.getItem('Pie')()  # Calls and logs pie()
    def cake_button_cb(self):
        self.menuitem.getItem('Cake')() # Calls and logs cake()

----------------------------------
----------------------------------

CLI Operation:

Assume that root is an OOFRootMenu instance.

>>> root.function()
executes the OOFMenuItem named 'function' in the menu.

If the function takes arguments (params), they can be provided as
  keywords:
>>> root.function(a='eh', pi=3.14)

If not all the arguments are provided in an interactive session, the
user will be prompted for the remainder:

>>> root.function(a='eh')
Enter pi [3.14]: 22/7

The value in braces is a default value to be used if the user doesn't
enter anything.  Any valid Python expression can be entered.  The
default value is the last value used for this parameter.

Items in submenus are accessed by typing the full path from the root
menu:

>>> root.submenu.subsubmenu.function()

To execute a number of commands from a single submenu, just define a
variable referring to the submenu:

>>> sub = root.submenu.subsubmenu
>>> sub.function()
>>> sub.otherfunction()

To get help, simply type an item's name, without the trailing parentheses.
