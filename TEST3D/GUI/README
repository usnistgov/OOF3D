This directory contains the GUI tests for OOF3D.  They tests ensure
that the user interface is working correctly: that the buttons,
sliders and other widgets are connected up properly, and that the
widgets are displayed and sensitized when they're supposed to be.
These tests generally do *not* do a thorough job of testing that the
underlying computations are correct.  Those tests are in the parent
directory, OOF3D/TEST3D.

[ The following text is from the OOF2 version of these tests.  Aside
from the specific names of the test files, all of the OOF2
instructions apply just as well to OOF3D.  However, please see the
OOF3D note at the end of this file. ]

The individual tests are contained in the subdirectories whose names
begin with five integers (00000_tutorial_basics, etc.)  The names
indicate which features the test tests.  XXXXX_tutorial_YYYYY runs
through the YYYYYY tutorial; XXXXX_page_ZZZZZ tests features of the
ZZZZZ page in the main OOF2 window.

RUNNING THE GUI TESTS

To run all the tests, open a terminal window, "cd" to this directory
(OOF2/TEST/GUI) and type

   python guitests.py

To run a single test, append the name of the test directory to the
command line.  For example, typing

   python guitests.py 00000_tutorial_basics

will run only the test in the 00000_tutorial_basics directory.  More
than one test can be specified at once, like this:

   python guitests.py 00000_tutorial_basics 00100_page_micro

You can also run a range of tests by using --from and --to, like this:

   python guitests.py --from 02000_tensor4 --to 02020_tensor2

If you only provide --from, the script will start at the given test and
run all successive tests.  If you only provide --to, the script will
start at the beginning (00000_tutorial_basics) and run all tests up to
and including the given test.  The order of the tests is determining
by the alphabetical ordering of the test names (including the
numerical prefix).

WHAT TO DO WITH THE RESULTS

If the tests succeed, the line "XXX tests ran successfully!", for some
value of XXX, will be printed at the end of a long string of messages.

If a test fails, the program will either hang (output to the terminal
window will cease) or will bring up an OOF2 error window.  If the
program hangs, you should try to quit it with the File/Quit menu item.
If that doesn't work, you will have use the Unix 'kill' or 'killall'
command from a terminal window.  On some systems you may have to use
'kill -9' to kill all the oof2 threads.

If a test brings up the OOF2 error window, you can quit by pressing
the "Abort" button.  If you press the "OK" button, you may still be
told that the test ran successfully, but don't be misled by that.

If a test fails, please run it again.  We believe that there are still
some timing problems in the testing code, and some test failures do
not indicate actual errors in the oof2 code.  To see which test
failed, scroll back in the terminal window until you see a line that
looks something like

--- Running oof2 --pathdir . --pathdir 12345_test_name/ --replay 12345_test_name/log.py

In this example, the test that failed is "12345_test_name".  You can
resume the full set of tests at 12345_test_name by running

   python guitests.py --from 12345_test_name

If a test fails repeatedly, please report it to
oof_bugs@nist.gov!  Please tell us which test failed and include
the last few lines of the screen output (at least the last line
beginning with "////// <number>" and anything after that).  Also,
please tell us what kind of computer you're using and the version
numbers of your operating system, compiler, and python interpreter.

CAUTION: The tests work by simulating user interaction from the
keyboard and the mouse.  It is very easy to confuse the testing
mechanism by typing or using the mouse while the tests are in
progress, since the program can't distinguish real keypresses and
clicks from simulated ones.  If a test fails, start it again, go get a
cup of coffee, and don't touch the computer until the test is done.


NOTE FOR OOF3D:  We've had trouble creating portable test involving
mouse clicks on the vtk graphics canvas.  If the tests fail, try
running them again using the --nocanvas option:

   python guitests.py --nocanvas

This will skip the problematic tests.
